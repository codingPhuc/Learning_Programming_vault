### **Books & Reading Materials**

- _What should I read?_ (19 Nov 2024)
- _Searching for authentic examples of poor or weak tech communication - memos, emails, reports, etc._ (06 Sep 2024) 
1. Read extensively. Do all the readings that are assigned to you during coursework. Read above and beyond. And keep reading.
    
2. Keep good notes as you read. Figure out how you'd like to note keep, and what themes there are important to you. You'd never know when they can be useful for lit. reviews or putting in for papers/ future chapters in your dissertation.
    
3. Keep a list of words that you need to know or use. Have a list of how different thinkers describe or define concepts or theories. (Example how is cultural hegemony understood. Or what's the genealogy of the field).
    
4. Map out ideas, themes, and influences. Draw out the relationships - seen and unseen.
    
5. Notice how people write (prolific writers or those in your field that you admire). Notice how they form their arguments. Note the movement of how they bring materials to the conversation. Notice how the structure of their books come about. Engage with how these patterns work for them. Ask yourself what works (or doesn't) in their writing. Is it something readable? And how do you make things readable for your audience?
    
6. Read and write. You learn writing by writing. It's a muscle. Keep writing. The first draft is never the final draft. Write. Re-write. Get someone else to look at it. Re-write.
    
7. Find your voice. Don't try to mimic others. You are now honing your voice to be a contributor to the field. Find that voice. Why is it distinct? What perspectives are you offering. Who are your influences?
    
8. Keep a journal. To vent... to flush out ideas. Write. Even if it's not "academic" writing. Write it out. You'd experience a whole lot of emotions through the program. You'd be frustrated with colleagues, professors, administrators, and toast not coming out right. You need to manage, or what they call "emotionally regulate". If you can afford for regular therapist sessions, great. If not writing in a journal might get things off your chest to take the pressure off.
    
9. Start somewhere... write even when you don't feel like it. Write using different mediums - paper to pencil, paper and fountain pen, paper and typewriter, ipad doodling, and etc. Whatever it is, write. Develop the writing muscles bit by bit.
