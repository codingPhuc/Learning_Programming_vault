In this chapter we take a look at a number of topics that are essential to every C++ program ,  we will  only cover shallow topics (just enough understanding to get by) . The goal of this program  is too structure how basic C++ is constructed , by the end you will be able to write your own C++ program 
The basic of a computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what todo . A statement is  a type of instructions that causes the program to perform an action
Statements are  a common types of  instruction in C++ . This is because they are the smallest unit of computation  in the C++ language . When we convey we write and speak in sentences , when we convey something to the computer we write in statement 
most statement in C++ end in a semicolon . In a high level language like C++   , a  single statement may compiler into a many machine  instructions 
There are many different kinds of statements in C++:
- Declaration statements
- Jump statements
- Expression statements
- Compound statements
- Selection statements (conditionals)
- Iteration statements (loops)
- Try blocks 

## Function and the main function 
In C++  statement  are group into unit call function  , a function  is a collection of statement  that get executed sequentially from top to bottom 
Rule : every C++ statement much a have a function name main  
program typically terminate (finish running ) after the last statement in function main has been executed  
Function are usually written to do a specific job  or perform a useful  action . For example , function name  max is create to figure out which of the two number is max 
you can write function name main and do something like for example  main()  dosomething() this is help different function from variable 
## Dissecting helloword 
Now  take a high look on each line of code about what each line of code do ? 

```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
```
the line of the program  : 
1. the first line  we declare a statement  `#include` , which tell us that we will be using the std:: count  in the iostream library  in our program excluding this line will result in a compiler errors because the program does not know what std::count is ?  
2. the second line is brank to improve program readability 
3. The third line tell us that we will create function who name is main  the int tell us that the function will return an  integer 
4. The firth line tell us that  we will used a statement containing std::count which is a function << which tell us to used "Hello world!" as output to the command line 
5. The six line tell us that we will return 0 as the output and the program will finish running 

## Syntax and syntax errors 
syntax error are errors that happen when your  syntax is not confine to the programming language guideline causing an errors . This is similar in English where you would encounter a grammatical errors 

Question #1

What is a statement?

Hide Solution

A statement is an instruction in a computer program that tells the computer to perform an action.

Question #2

What is a function?

Hide Solution

A function is a collection of statements that executes sequentially.

Question #3

What is the name of the function that all programs must have?

Hide Solution

main

Question #4

What happens when the program is run?

![Ezoic](https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png "ezoic")

Hide Solution

The statements inside `main()` are executed in sequential order.

Question #5

What symbol are statements in C++ often ended with?

Hide Solution

The semicolon (`;`)

Question #6

What is a syntax error?

Hide Solution

A syntax error is a compiler error that occurs at compile-time when your program violates the grammar rules of the C++ language.

Question #7

What is the C++ Standard Library?

Show Hint

Hide Solution

A library file is a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” for reuse in other programs. The C++ Standard Library is a library that ships with C++. It contains additional functionality to use in your programs.
