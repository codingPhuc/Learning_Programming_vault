A Computer program is a sequence of instruction for computers. There are many type of language available ,  each of which cater to a specific set of need. The act of writting a program is call  programming . We will talk more about how to write a program  in C++  in the upcoming lesson in this chapter 
When  a computer is performing an action described by the instructions in a computer program , we call it running or executing the program . A computer will not execute the program until told so 
Program are executed on a computer hardware  , which consist of the physical components that make ups a computer. Notable hardware found on a typical  computing devices includes : 
- A CPU  (central processing unit ,  often called  the "brain" of the computer), which actually executes the instructions  
- Memory where the program are loaded  prior to execution  
- Interactive devices which allow the person to interact with a computer
