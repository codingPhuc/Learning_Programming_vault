A Computer program is a sequence of instruction for computers. There are many type of language available ,  each of which cater to a specific set of need. The act of writting a program is call  programming . We will talk more about how to write a program  in C++  in the upcoming lesson in this chapter 
When  a computer is performing an action described by the instructions in a computer program , we call it running or executing the program . A computer will not execute the program until told so 
Program are executed on a computer hardware  , which consist of the physical components that make ups a computer. Notable hardware found on a typical  computing devices includes : 
- A CPU  (central processing unit ,  often called  the "brain" of the computer), which actually executes the instructions  
- Memory where the program are loaded  prior to execution  
- Storage  devices (a hard drive , SSD , or flash  memory ) which retain  information (including installed program) even when the computer is turned off  
The term  software are program  on the system that are design to be executed  on a hardware 
In modern  computer pr
- Interactive devices which allow the person to interact with a computer ograms often interact with more than just hardware  they also interact with  other software  on the system(particularly the operating system) . The term platform refers to a compatible set of hardware and  software  (OS , browser , etc) That provides an environemnt for software to run. For example the terms  PC  is used to refer to window system  on a  x86 family CPU 
Platform often provide useful  services for the program running them. For example , an application may request functionality from the operating system like play music for them  , give them a chunk of memory and create file over their. an program easy to transfer from one platform to another is said to be portable 

## how machine understand 
A computer CPU is not able to understand C++. Instead , CPU are only capable of processing instruction written in machine language(or  machine code) all possible machine language (or machine code) The set of possible  machine language instruction  a machine that a given CPU can understand is an instruction set 
Here is a sample machine language instruction 10110000 01100001  
each computer have  to be implemented in the machine for a specific job like "write here" "read here" Programmer have to write directly to machine language which was very time comsuming 

Each instruction  of compose of a sequence of number like 1s and 0s. Each individual 1 and 0 is called binary digit , bit  for short. The number of bit in a machine language vary CPU  process instruction are always 32 bits long whereas other CPUs like x86 can vary in length  
there is also differences in machine language family . As a result,  a  machine language running on 1  family cannot run on another

## Assembly languages  
because  machine language is so hard to read and understand, assembly language was invented. In an assembly language(often called  assembly) each instruction is identify as short  abbreviation 
here is an assembly language :  mov al ,  061l 
mov is an x86 assembly instruction that copies a value into some location. In that case , the value  061h will be copied  into the al CPU register(memory) 
this make writing in assembly more easily read and write  than machine language . Programs written  in machine language tend to be very fast  , and assembly is still used today wehn  speed is critical 
However since GPU can only speak in machine  language it require an assembler which translate  the assembly language to  machine language 
just as each CPU family have it own machine language ,  each assembly have it own family as well . As a result , this make it easier for assembly to be used in it specific CPU family 

# low level  language
machine language and assembly language are consider low level language , as these language require minimal abstraction from the architecture of the machine . In other word, the programming language itself is tailored to the specifit instruction  it will be run on  
Low level language have many notable downside  : 
- Program written in   a low-level language is not portable . Since the low level language is tailor to ISA(Instruction set Architecture)   
- Writing a program   in a low-level language  requires detailed knowledge  of the architecture it self. For instance , the instruction mov al , 061h is call to invorce the operation on a specifit register .   This register might be named something different  , have different limitations , or not exist at all 
- Low  level programming language  are hard to understand . While individual  assembly instructions can be quite understandable, it can be hard to reduce what a section of assembly code is doing . Since assembly program require many instruction to do even simple task , 

# High level language 

Much like assembly program written using a complier need to be translated into machine code before running . There are two main way compiling and interpreting 

C++ is usually complied . A compiler is a program ( or colletion of program) that translate  code in a high level language into  another language( usually machine code ) .For example,  C++ compiler translates C++  source code into machine code  

In the beginning compiler where  were primitive  and produced slow code   , unoptimize assembly or machine code . However , over the year compiler have become very good at producing  fast , optimize code  , and in some cases  do better jobs than human

Interpreters is a program that directly execute the instruction in the source code without them needing to be compiler  first, but are less effcient when running program because the interpreted process need to be run each time the program execute 
here is a simplified representation of the interpretation process

A good comparison of the advantages of compilers vs interpreters can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38491646).

Another advantage of compiled programs is that distributing a compiled program does not require distributing the source code. In a non-open-source environment, this is important for intellectual property (IP) protection purposes. 


most high level language can either be interpreted or  compiler 



Consider the instruction `a = 97;`. This instruction lets us store the value `97` somewhere in memory, without needing to know exactly where that value will be placed, or what specific machine code instruction is needed by the CPU to store that value. In fact, there is nothing platform-specific about this instruction at all. The compiler does all the work to figure out how this C++ instruction translates into platform-specific machine code.

High-level languages allow programmers to write programs without knowing much about the platform it will be run on. This not only makes programs easier to write, it also makes them significantly more portable. If we’re careful, we can write a single C++ that will compile on every platform that has a C++ compiler! A program that is designed to run on multiple platforms is said to be **cross-platform**.


# For advance reader 
The following is a partial list of things that can inhibit the portability of your C++ code:

- Many operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, offer platform-specific capabilities that you can use in your code. These can make it much easier to write a program for a specific operating system, or provide deeper integration with that operating system than would otherwise be possible.
- Many third-party libraries are only available on certain platforms. If you use one of these, you will be limited to the platforms for which that library is supported.
- Some compilers support compiler-specific extensions, which are capabilities that are only available in that compiler. If you use these, your programs won’t be able to be compiled by other compilers that don’t support the same extensions without modification. We’ll talk more about these later, once you’ve installed a compiler.
- In certain cases, the C++ language allows the compiler to determine how something should behave. We discuss this further in lesson [1.6 -- Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/uninitialized-variables-and-undefined-behavior/) under “implementation-defined behavior”.

If you’re only targeting a single platform, then portability may not matter that much. But many applications these days target multiple platforms in order to widen their reach. For example, a mobile app will probably want to target both iOS and Android.

Even if portability doesn’t seem useful initially, many applications that initially targeted a single platform (e.g. PC) decided to port to other platforms (e.g. Mac and various consoles) after seeing some level of success and interest. If you don’t start with portability in mind, it will be more work to port your application later. 





# high level language benefit 
High-level languages have other benefits as well:

- Programs written in a high-level language are easier to read, write, and learn because their instructions more closely resemble the natural language and mathematics that we use every day. In many cases, high-level languages require fewer instructions to perform the same tasks as low-level languages. For example, in C++ you can write `a = b * 2 + 5;` in one line. In assembly language, this would take 4 to 6 different instructions. This makes programs written using high-level languages more concise, which makes them easier to understand.
- High-level languages typically include additional capabilities that make it easier to perform common programming tasks, such as requesting a block of memory or manipulating text. For example, it only takes a single instruction to determine whether the characters “abc” exist within a large block of text (and if so, how many characters has to be examined until “abc” was found). This can dramatically reduce complexity and development times. 


# Author notes 
Today, C++ would probably be more accurately described as a mid-level language. However, this also highlights one of C++’s key strengths: it often provides the ability to work at different levels of abstraction. You can choose to operate at a lower level for better performance and precision, or at a higher level for greater convenience and simplicity.

Rules, Best practices, and warnings  



## question 
If a compiler produces machine code - then isn't that machine code produced as per the ISA that is specific to the hardware that it was compiled on? What allows the executable to run without issues on other processors?

I guess what I'm asking is if different instructions can have different implementations on different platforms - say Intel vs AMD.
