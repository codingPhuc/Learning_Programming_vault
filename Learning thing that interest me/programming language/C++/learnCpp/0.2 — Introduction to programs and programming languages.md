A Computer program is a sequence of instruction for computers. There are many type of language available ,  each of which cater to a specific set of need. The act of writting a program is call  programming . We will talk more about how to write a program  in C++  in the upcoming lesson in this chapter 
When  a computer is performing an action described by the instructions in a computer program , we call it running or executing the program . A computer will not execute the program until told so 
Program are executed on a computer hardware  , which consist of the physical components that make ups a computer. Notable hardware found on a typical  computing devices includes : 
- A CPU  (central processing unit ,  often called  the "brain" of the computer), which actually executes the instructions  
- Memory where the program are loaded  prior to execution  
- Interactive devices which allow the person to interact with a computer 
- Storage  devices (a hard drive , SSD , or flash  memory ) which retain  information (including installed program) even when the computer is turned off  
The term  software are program  on the system that are design to be executed  on a hardware 


In modern  computer programs often interact with more than just hardware  they also interact with  other software  on the system(particularly the operating system) . The term platform refers to a compatible set of hardware and  software  (OS , browser , etc) That provides an environemnt for software to run. For example the terms  PC  is used to refer to window system  on a  x86 family CPU 
Platform often provide usefull services for the program running them. For example , an application may request functionality from the operating system like play music for them  , give them a chunk of memory and create file over their. an program easy to transfer from one platform to another is said to be portable 

## how machine understand 
A computer CPU is not able to understand C++. Instead , CPU are only capable of processing instruction written in machine language(or  machine code) all possible machine language (or machine code) The set of possible  machine language instruction  a machine that a given CPU can understand is an instruction set 
Here is a sample machine language instruction 10110000 01100001  
each computer have  to be implemented in the machine for a specific job like "write here" "read here" Programmer have to write directly to machine language which was very time comsuming 

Each instruction  of compose of a sequence of number like 1s and 0s. Each individual 1 and 0 is called binary digit , bit  for short. The number of bit in a machine language vary CPU  process instruction are always 32 bits long whereas other CPUs like x86 can vary in length  
there is also differences in machine language family . For an example , family with a
