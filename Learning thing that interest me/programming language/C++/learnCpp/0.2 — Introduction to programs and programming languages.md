A Computer program is a sequence of instruction for computers. There are many type of language available ,  each of which cater to a specific set of need. The act of writting a program is call  programming . We will talk more about how to write a program  in C++  in the upcoming lesson in this chapter 
When  a computer is performing an action described by the instructions in a computer program , we call it running or executing the program . A computer will not execute the program until told so 
Program are executed on a computer hardware  , which consist of the physical components that make ups a computer. Notable hardware found on a typical  computing devices includes : 
- A CPU  (central processing unit ,  often called  the "brain" of the computer), which actually executes the instructions  
- Memory where the program are loaded  prior to execution  
- Interactive devices which allow the person to interact with a computer 
- Storage  devices (a hard drive , SSD , or flash  memory ) which retain  information (including installed program) even when the computer is turned off  
The term  software are program  on the system that are design to be executed  on a hardware 


In modern  computer programs often interact with more than just hardware  they also interact with  other software  on the system(particularly the operating system) . The term platform refers to a compatible set of hardware and  software  (OS , browser , etc) That provides an environemnt for software to run. For example the terms  PC  is used to refer to window system  on a  x86 family CPU 
Platform often provide usefull services for the program running them. For example , an application may request functionality from the operating system like play music for them  , give them a chunk of memory and create file over their. an program easy to transfer from one platform to another is said to be portable 

## how machine understand 
A computer CPU is not able to understand C++. Instead , CPU are only capable of processing instruction written in machine language(or  machine code) all possible machine language (or machine code) The set of possible  machine language instruction  a machine that a given CPU can understand is an instruction set 
Here is a sample machine language instruction 10110000 01100001  
each computer have  to be implemented in the machine for a specific job like "write here" "read here" Programmer have to write directly to machine language which was very time comsuming 

Each instruction  of compose of a sequence of number like 1s and 0s. Each individual 1 and 0 is called binary digit , bit  for short. The number of bit in a machine language vary CPU  process instruction are always 32 bits long whereas other CPUs like x86 can vary in length  
there is also differences in machine language family . As a result,  a  machine language running on 1  family cannot run on another

## Assembly languages  
because  machine language is so hard to read and understand, assembly language was invented. In an assembly language(often called  assembly) each instruction is identify as short  abbreviation 
here is an assembly language :  mov al ,  061l 
mov is an x86 assembly instruction that copies a value into some location. In that case , the value  061h will be copied  into the al CPU register(memory) 
this make writing in assembly more easily read and write  than machine language . Programs written  in machine language tend to be very fast  , and assembly is still used today wehn  speed is critical 
However since GPU can only speak in machine  language it require an assembler which translate  the assembly language to  machine language 
just as each CPU family have it own machine language ,  each assembly have it own family as well . As a result , this make it easier for assembly to be used in it specific CPU family
