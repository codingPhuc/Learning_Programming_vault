A build configure(also called a build target) is a collection of project setting that determine  how your IDE will build your project . The build configuration will look  for what the executable file will be name , where the library and dependency for the files while be store in which  directories , strips  of debugger information  , how much  compiler optimize your solution and ect  .  
When you create your IDE most IDE  will create two different type of configuration for you , a release configuration , and debug configuration 
The debug configuration is designed to help you debug your program , and is generally the one you will used to write your program . This make your program run slower and increase the capacity , but make it much more easy to debug . The debug configuration is set as active configuration for default 

the  release configuration is  used when realesing your program to public . This version is optimize for size and performance and doesn't contain extra debugging information . This mode i usefull for testing the performance of your code
