In order to compiler a C++ source code  , we used C++  compiler.  
the compiler do two importance thing : 
1. is it compiler the source code it will check every line of your source code to see if you confine to the C++ coding language 
2. Second the file then translate the C++ code into machine language instruction. These instruction are stored in an intermediate file  called an object file . The object file also contain data that are require  in subsequence step

C++ compilers are available for  many different operating system  

## Step 5: Linking object files and libraries
