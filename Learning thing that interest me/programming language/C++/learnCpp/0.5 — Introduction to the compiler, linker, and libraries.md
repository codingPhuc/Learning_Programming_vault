In order to compiler a C++ source code  , we used C++  compiler.  
the compiler do two importance thing : 
1. is it compiler the source code it will check every line of your source code to see if you confine to the C++ coding language 
2. Second the file then translate the C++ code into machine language instruction. These instruction are stored in an intermediate file  called an object file . The object file also contain data that are require  in subsequence step

C++ compilers are available for  many different operating system  

## Step 5: Linking object files and libraries 
after  the  compiler has successfully  finished ,  another program called the linker kick in . The linker jobs is too combine all the object files and produce the desire result this is call linking 

First the linker read all of the object file on the compiler to make sure that they are valid 
second the linker ensure that all cross file dependency are resloved properly. For example , if you define or something that used another .cpp file let say the depend .cpp file then used it in the dependent .cpp file you can get a Linker errors when  the depend .cpp function or object does not exit  
you can also link library file   library file are precompile code that have been package to be ship and used in other program 

you can also optionally link other libraries. For example , if you were going to write  a program that played sound , you should not write your own code too read the sound file from the disk , check to ensure they are valid  , check and route the sound file to your operating system  . Instead you should download a library to do those thing and used it

Finally the link file output the desire output file 


Step 6 &7 : Testing and debugging
