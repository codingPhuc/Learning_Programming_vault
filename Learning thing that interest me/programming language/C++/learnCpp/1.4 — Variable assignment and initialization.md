As a reminder, here’s a short program that first allocates a single integer variable named `x`, then allocates two more integer variables named `y` and `z`: 

## Variable assignment  
ou can give it a value (in a separate statement) using the `=` operator. This process is called **assignment**, and the `=` operator is called the **assignment operator**. 
```
int width; // define an integer variable named width
width = 5; // assignment of value 5 into variable width

// variable width now has value 5
```
By default, assignment copies the value on the right-hand side of the _= operator_ to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. This is called **copy-assignment**.  
Once a variable has been given a value, the value of that variable can be printed via `std::cout` and the `<<` operator. 
Assignment can be used whenever we want to change the value held by a variable. 
```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int width; // define a variable named width
	width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width

	std::cout << width; // prints 5

	width = 7; // change value stored in variable width to 7

	std::cout << width; // prints 7

	return 0;
}
```
This prints: 57 
program explanation : 
1. in the  firth line the program define a variable  name with with the datatypes of  int 
2. the eight line  the variable width is printed  on the screen  with a value of 5 
3. the 10 line  the variable width is overwritten with a value of 7 
4. the 12 line print the width  with the value of 7  
5. then return 0 
Warning : One of the most common mistakes that new programmers make is to confuse the assignment operator (`=`) with the equality operator (`==`). Assignment (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. Equality (`==`) is used to test whether two operands are equal in value.  

## Variable initialization  
One downside of assignment is that assigning a value to a just-defined object requires two statements: one to define the variable, and another to assign the value.  
hese two steps can be combined. When an object is defined, you can optionally provide an initial value for the object. The process of specifying an initial value for an object is called **initialization**, and the syntax used to initialize an object is called an **initializer**. Informally, the initial value is often called an “initializer” as well.

For example, the following statement both defines a variable named `width` (of type `int`) and initializes it with the value `5`:
```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int width { 5 };    // define variable width and initialize with initial value 5
    std::cout << width; // prints 5

    return 0;
}
```

In the above initialization of variable `width`, `{ 5 }` is the initializer, and `5` is the initial value.  
## Different forms of initialization

Unlike assignment (which is generally straightforward), initialization in C++ is surprisingly complex. So we’ll present a simplified view here to get started.

There are 5 common forms of initialization in C++: 
```
int a;         // default-initialization (no initializer)

// Traditional initialization forms:
int b = 5;     // copy-initialization (initial value after equals sign)
int c ( 6 );   // direct-initialization (initial value in parenthesis)

// Modern initialization forms (preferred):
int d { 7 };   // direct-list-initialization (initial value in braces)
int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces)
```


As of C++17, copy-initialization, direct-initialization, and direct-list-initialization behave identically in most cases. We’ll cover the most relevant case where they differ below.
## For advanced readers

Other forms of initialization include:

- Aggregate initialization (see [13.8 -- Struct aggregate initialization](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/struct-aggregate-initialization/)).
- Copy-list-initialization (discussed below).
- Reference initialization (see [12.3 -- Lvalue references](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/lvalue-references/)).
- Static-initialization, constant-initialization, and dynamic-initialization (see [7.8 -- Why (non-const) global variables are evil](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/why-non-const-global-variables-are-evil/)).
- Zero-initialization (discussed below).
## Default-initialization 
When no initializer is provided (such as for variable `a` above), this is called **default-initialization**. In many cases, default-initialization performs no initialization, and leaves the variable with an indeterminate value (a value that is not predictable, sometimes called a “garbage value”). 

## Copy-initialization 

When an initial value is provided  after and equal sign  , this is call copy  initialization . This form of initialization was inherited from C  language. 

``` 
int width = 5; // copy-initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

Much like copy-assignment . The variable on the right hand side will  be copy to the variable on the left hand side. In the above snippet ,variable width will be initialize with value of  5 
Copy  initialization have been  over taken by other initialization due to it in  inefficiency . But it have had an upgrade  in C++  17  making it a more attractive  for other developer.  Also the copy initialization is also  used by older version because of developer who are more similar to C style 


## Direct initialization  
When an initialize value is provided inside a parentheses , this is called a direct-initialization 
```
int width ( 5 ); // direct initialization of value 5 into variable width
```
Direct initialization is used for creation of complex object ,  (those with classes which we will cover in the next chapter) . Just like copy initialization direct-initialization have fallen out of favor in modern C++ due to the introduction of direct-list initialization 
. However direct  initialization have a few quick of it own  , and so direct-initialization find in used in some cases 
For advanced readers : Direct-initialization is also used when values are explicitly cast to another type (e.g. via `static_cast`).  

## List-Initialization 
the modern way of initializing object in C++ is to used something call list initialization . which require curly braces 

```
int width { 5 };    // direct-list-initialization of initial value 5 into variable width (preferred)
int height = { 6 }; // copy-list-initialization of initial value 6 into variable height (rarely used)
```
Prior to C++ 11 , it was hard to differentiate copy  initialization and  copy assignment   due to  the similar syntax  and list initialization from  function  . As a result   ,  list initialization was create
for an unambiguous call to initialize and object 
key insight :  when we see curly braces we know that it is an list initialize object 
list initialize also help with  adding more than 1 value to an  object hence the name   list initialization 

## List-initialization disallows narrowing conversions 
One of the primary benefit of list initialization is 'narrowing conversion is not allow . This mean that if you  initialized  a value that is not safe for the variable to hold then it will output a list diagnostic (compilation erros or warning) 

```
int main()
{
    // An integer can only hold non-fractional values.
    // Initializing an int with fractional value 4.5 requires the compiler to convert 4.5 to a value an int can hold.
    // Such a conversion is a narrowing conversion, since the fractional part of the value will be lost.

    int w1 { 4.5 }; // compile error: list-init does not allow narrowing conversion

    int w2 = 4.5;   // compiles: w2 copy-initialized to value 4
    int w3 (4.5);   // compiles: w3 direct-initialized to value 4

    return 0;
}
```


```
int main()
{
    int w1 { 4.5 }; // compile error: list-init does not allow narrowing conversion of 4.5 to 4

    w1 = 4.5;       // okay: copy-assignment allows narrowing conversion of 4.5 to 4

    return 0;
}
```


## Value-initialization and zero-initialization 
When a value is initialize using an empty set of braces  , a special form of list initialization take place  . In most cases  ,  value initialization will initialize the variable to 0 .  in cases when zeroing occurs , this is call zero-initialization   

```
int width {}; // value-initialization / zero-initialization to value 0
```
## List-initialization is the preferred form of initialization in modern C++ 
List-initialization(including  value-initialization)  is generally preferred  over other initialization form because it work in most cases  (and is therefore most consistent) , it disable narrowing conversion(which we normally don't want) ,and it support initialization with a list of value  
Best practice :  Prefer direct-list-initialization or value-initialization to initialize your variables. 
Author’s note :  Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++) and Herb Sutter (C++ expert) also recommend [using list-initialization](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-list) to initialize your variables.
In modern C++, there are some cases where list-initialization does not work as expected. We cover one such case in lesson [16.2 -- Introduction to std::vector and list constructors](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-stdvector-and-list-constructors/). Because of such quirks, some experienced developers now advocate for using a mix of copy, direct, and list-initialization, depending on the circumstance. Once you are familiar enough with the language to understand the nuances of each initialization type and the reasoning behind such recommendations, you can evaluate on your own whether you find these arguments persuasive. 

When should I initialize with { 0 } vs {}? :   
used direct-list initialization when you're actually using the initial values : 
```
int x { 0 };    // direct-list-initialization with initial value 0
std::cout << x; // we're using that 0 value here
``` 
Use value-initialization when the object’s value is temporary and will be replaced: 
```
int x {};      // value initialization
std::cin >> x; // we're immediately replacing that value so an explicit 0 would be meaningless
```
## Initialize your variables 
Initialize your  variables bases on creation. You  may eventual find cases where you want to ignore this advice for specific reason (eg preformance critical section of the code that used a lot of variable )

## Instantiation 
The term instantiation is a word that mean that the variable  has been created and initialized  (this include default initialization) An instantiated  object is sometimes called an instance . Most often , this term is apply to class type object , but is occasionally  apply to object of other types as well 
## Initializing multiple variables 
In the last section, we noted that it is possible to define multiple variables _of the same type_ in a single statement by separating the names with a comma:

```cpp
int a, b; // create variables a and b, but do not initialize them
```

Copy

We also noted that best practice is to avoid this syntax altogether. However, since you may encounter other code that uses this style, it’s still useful to talk a little bit more about it, if for no other reason than to reinforce some of the reasons you should be avoiding it.

You can initialize multiple variables defined on the same line:

```cpp
int a = 5, b = 6;          // copy-initialization
int c ( 7 ), d ( 8 );      // direct-initialization
int e { 9 }, f { 10 };     // direct-list-initialization
int i {}, j {};            // value-initialization
```

Copy

Unfortunately, there’s a common pitfall here that can occur when the programmer mistakenly tries to initialize both variables by using one initialization statement:

```cpp
int a, b = 5;     // wrong: a is not initialized to 5!
int a = 5, b = 5; // correct: a and b are initialized to 5
```

Copy

In the top statement, variable `a` will be left uninitialized, and the compiler may or may not complain. If it doesn’t, this is a great way to have your program intermittently crash or produce sporadic results. We’ll talk more about what happens if you use uninitialized variables shortly.

The best way to remember that this is wrong is to note that each variable can only be initialized by its own initializer:

```cpp
int a = 4, b = 5; // correct: a and b both have initializers
int a, b = 5;     // wrong: a doesn't have its own initializer
```

Copy

Unused initialized variables warnings

Modern compilers will typically generate warnings if a variable is initialized but not used (since this is rarely desirable). And if “treat warnings as errors” is enabled, these warnings will be promoted to errors and cause the compilation to fail.

Consider the following innocent looking program:

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x { 5 }; // variable x defined

    // but not used anywhere

    return 0;
}
```

Copy

When compiling this with GCC and “treat warnings as errors” on, the following error is generated:

```
prog.cc: In function 'int main()':
prog.cc:3:9: error: unused variable 'x' [-Werror=unused-variable]
```
and the program fails to compile.  
1. If the variable really is unused and you don’t need it, then the easiest option is to remove the definition of `x` (or comment it out). After all, if it’s not used, then removing it won’t affect anything.
2. Another option is to simply use the variable somewhere:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };

    std::cout << x; // variable now used somewhere

    return 0;
}
```

Copy

But this requires some effort to write code that uses it, and has the downside of potentially changing your program’s behavior.  


n some cases, neither of the above options are desirable. Consider the case where we have a set of math/physics values that we use in many different programs:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Here's some math/physics values that we copy-pasted from elsewhere
    double pi { 3.14159 };
    double gravity { 9.8 };
    double phi { 1.61803 };

    std::cout << pi << '\n';  // pi is used
    std::cout << phi << '\n'; // phi is used

    // The compiler will likely complain about gravity being defined but unused

    return 0;
}
```

Copy

If we use these values a lot, we probably have these saved somewhere and copy/paste/import them all together.

However, in any program where we don’t use _all_ of these values, the compiler will likely complain about each variable that isn’t actually used. In the above example, we could easily just remove the definition of `gravity`. But what if there were 20 or 30 variables instead of 3? And what if we use them in multiple places? Going through the list of variables to remove/comment out the unused ones takes time and energy. And later if we need one that we’ve previously removed, we’ll have to spend more time and energy to go back and re-add/uncomment it.

To address such cases, C++17 introduced the `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute, which allows us to tell the compiler that we’re okay with a variable being unused. The compiler will not generate unused variable warnings for such variables.

The following program should generate no warnings/errors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    [[maybe_unused]] double pi { 3.14159 };  // Don't complain if pi is unused
    [[maybe_unused]] double gravity { 9.8 }; // Don't complain if gravity is unused
    [[maybe_unused]] double phi { 1.61803 }; // Don't complain if phi is unused

    std::cout << pi << '\n';
    std::cout << phi << '\n';

    // The compiler will no longer warn about gravity not being used

    return 0;
}
```

Copy

Additionally, the compiler will likely optimize these variables out of the program, so they have no performance impact.

The `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute should only be applied selectively to variables that have a specific and legitimate reason for being unused (e.g. because you need a list of named values, but which specific values are actually used in a given program may vary). Otherwise, unused variables should be removed from the program. 

Question #1

What is the difference between initialization and assignment?

Hide Solution

Initialization gives a variable an initial value at the point when it is created. Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the variable is created.

Question #2

What form of initialization should you prefer when you want to initialize a variable with a specific value?

Hide Solution

Direct-list-initialization (aka. direct brace initialization).

Question #3

What are default-initialization and value-initialization? What is the behavior of each? Which should you prefer?

Hide Solution

Default-initialization is when a variable initialization has no initializer (e.g. `int x;`). In most cases, the variable is left with an indeterminate value.

Value-initialization is when a variable initialization has an empty brace initializer (e.g. `int x{};`). In most cases this will perform zero-initialization.

You should prefer value-initialization, as it initializes the variable to a consistent value.
