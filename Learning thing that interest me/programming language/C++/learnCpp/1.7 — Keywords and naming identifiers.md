The key word mark by C++20 were added in C++20 so if your compiler does not have compatibility with C++ 20 or turn off keyword for C++20 , you cannot used them 
C++ also have special identifiers : override , final , import , module . These have special meaning when used in certain context but is not used otherwise 

You have already run across some of these keywords, including _int_ and _return_. Along with a set of operators, these keywords and special identifiers define the entire language of C++ (preprocessor commands excluded). Because keywords and special identifiers have special meaning, your IDEs will likely change the text color of these words to make them stand out from other identifiers.

## Identifier naming rules 
The name of a variable(or function  , type,  or other kind of items ) is called an identifier. C++ gives you a lot of flexibility to name identifiers as you wise  with the addition of a few rules : 
- The identifier cannot be keyword . keyword are reserved 
- The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case) , numbers  , and  the underscore character . That mean that the name cannot contain symbols (except the underscore) nor whitespace(spaces or tabs) 
- The identifier must begin with a letter(lower or uppercase) or an underscore . it cannot start with a number 
- C++ is case sensitive , and thus distinguishes between lower and upper case letter . nvalue is different than `nVlaue` is different than `NVALUE` 
## Identifier naming best practices 
now that you know how you can name a variable , let's talk about how you should name a vairable 
1. it is conventional in C++ that a variable name should begin with a lowercase letter . If the variable name is a single word or  acronym , the whole thing should be written in lowercases 
```
int value; // conventional

int Value; // unconventional (should start with lower case letter)
int VALUE; // unconventional (should start with lower case letter and be in all lower case)
int VaLuE; // unconventional (see your psychiatrist) ;)
```
Most often ,  function name also start with lower cases letter ( thought  there's some disagreement on this point) . All function in C++  start with a lowercases letter 
Identifier name also start with a lower cases letter are typically used for user define function (suck as struct,  classes , and enumerations , all of which we will cover latter)
if the variable name or function name is multi word , there are two common convention : word separated by underscore (sometimes  called snake_cases) or intercapped (sometime called  camelCase) 
```
int my_variable_name;   // conventional (separated by underscores/snake_case)
int my_function_name(); // conventional (separated by underscores/snake_case)

int myVariableName;     // conventional (intercapped/camelCase)
int myFunctionName();   // conventional (intercapped/camelCase)

int my variable name;   // invalid (whitespace not allowed)
int my function name(); // invalid (whitespace not allowed)

int MyVariableName;     // unconventional (should start with lower case letter)
int MyFunctionName();   // unconventional (should start with lower case letter)
```
In this tutorial we will used the intercapped approach because it's easier to read (it easy to mistake an underscore for a space in a dense block of code  ) 
the C++ library used underscore method for both variables and function. Sometime you will see a mic of the two : uderscore use for variable and intercaps used for function 
you should follow the coding style bases on something someone style above 
## best practice 
when working in an exiting program  ,used that program convention (even if they don't conform  to modern best practice)  . Use modern best practice when you are writing a new program 
1. Avoid naming your identifier starting with an underscore . Although syntactically legal , these name  reserved for OS , library , and / or compiler use 
2. The name of your identifier should make clear what the value they hold mean (particularly if the units aren't obvius) .In 3 month when you look back at your program you will understand what it does 
A good rule of thumb is making the lenght of the identifier proportion and specific to how accessible the identifier is . 

- An identifier that exists for only a few statements (e.g. in the body of a short function) can have a shorter name.
- An identifier that is accessible from anywhere might benefit from a longer name.
- An identifier that represents a non-specific number (e.g. anything the user provides) can have a shorter name.
- An identifier that represents a specific value (e.g. the length of an inseam in millimeters) should have a longer name.

| int totalScore             | Either | Okay if there’s only one thing being scored, otherwise too ambiguous |
| int _count                 | Bad    | Do not start names with underscore                                   |

For variable declaration , it can be useful to use a comment to describe what a variable is going to be used for , or to explain anything else that might not be obvious. For an example , let say that we name the text "hello word" a variable name we do not need to write out a long name like 
`numCharsIncludingWhitespaceAndPunctuation` , a well  place comment should also do the trick

Question #1

Based on how you _should_ name a variable, indicate whether each variable name is conventional (follows best practices), unconventional (compiler will accept but does not follow best practices), or invalid (will not compile), and why.

int sum {};

(Assume it’s obvious what we’re summing)  
Hide Solution

Conventional.

int _apples {};  
Hide Solution

Unconventional -- variable names should not start with an underscore.

int VALUE {};  
Hide Solution

Unconventional -- single word names should be in all lower case.

int my variable name {};  
Hide Solution

Invalid -- variable names can not contain spaces.

int TotalCustomers {};  
Hide Solution

Unconventional -- variable names should start with a lower case letter.

int void {};  
Hide Solution

Invalid -- void is a keyword.

int numFruit {};  
Hide Solution

Conventional.

int 3some {};  
Hide Solution

Invalid -- variable names can not start with a number.

int meters_of_pipe {};  
Hide Solution

Conventional.
