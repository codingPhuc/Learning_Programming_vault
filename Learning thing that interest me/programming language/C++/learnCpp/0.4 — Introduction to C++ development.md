Before we write and execute our first C++ program , We need to understand in detail how C++ program get developed . Here is a graphic outlining a simplistic  approach

## Step 1: Define the problem that you would like to solve 
This is The what step in your development  figuring out what you are  trying to solve . Coming up  with the initial idea about what you want the program to do .But conceptually , it the simplies , all you need is an idea that is well define  
- “I want to write a program that will allow me to enter many numbers, then calculates the average.”   
## Step 2: Determine how you are going to solve the problem 
In this step you need to think of "How" are you going to solve for step  1. It is also the step that is most neglected in software development. Too many programmer just code without thinking about a good solution because there is solution that is bad and there is a solutoin that is good 
- They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing). 
-  They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
- They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
- They can recover gracefully or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.
When you sit down and start coding right away , you're typically thinking " I want to do something" so you implement as solution that get you there. But this can lead you to  a fragile program that is not flexible to your application changing need 
various study have shown that 10-40 % of software cost is building and the other 60% is on finding bug 
Consequently , it's is worth your time to spend a little extra time upfront about how you would tackle the problem  
## Step 3: Write the program
