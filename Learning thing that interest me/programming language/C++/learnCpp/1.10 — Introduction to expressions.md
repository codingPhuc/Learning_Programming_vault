```
// five() is a function that returns the value 5
int five()
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    int a{ 2 };             // initialize variable a with literal value 2
    int b{ 2 + 3 };         // initialize variable b with computed value 5
    int c{ (2 * 3) + 4 };   // initialize variable c with computed value 10
    int d{ b };             // initialize variable d with variable value 5
    int e{ five() };        // initialize variable e with function return value 5

    return 0;
}
```


Note that the initializers above make use of a variety of different entities: literals, variables, operators, and function calls. Somehow, C++ is converting all of these different things into a single value that can then be used as the initial value for the variable.

What do all of these initializers have in common? They make use of an expression.

In general programming, an **expression** is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a value. The process of executing an expression is called **evaluation**, and the resulting value produced is called the **result** of the expression (also sometimes called the **return value**).

## for advanced readers 
In C++, the result of an expression is one of the following:

- A value (most commonly)
- An object or a function. We discuss expressions that return objects in lesson [12.2 -- Value categories (lvalues and rvalues)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/value-categories-lvalues-and-rvalues/).
- Nothing. These are the result of non-value returning function calls (covered in lesson [2.3 -- Void functions (non-value returning functions)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/void-functions-non-value-returning-functions/)) that are called only for their side effects

For now, to keep things simple, we’ll assume expressions are evaluated to produce values. 


When an expression is evaluated, each of the terms inside the expression are evaluated, until a single value remains. Here are some examples of different kinds of expressions, with comments indicating how they evaluate:


```
2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
"Hello world!"  // "Hello world!" is a literal that evaluates to text "Hello world!"
x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value held by variable x
2 + 3           // operator+ uses operands 2 and 3 to evaluate to value 5
five()          // evaluates to the return value of function five()
```
2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
"Hello world!"  // "Hello world!" is a literal that evaluates to text "Hello world!"
x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value held by variable x
2 + 3           // operator+ uses operands 2 and 3 to evaluate to value 5
five()          // evaluates to the return value of function five()

```
x = 5           // x = 5 has side effect of assigning 5 to x, evaluates to x
x = 2 + 3       // has side effect of assigning 5 to x, evaluates to x
std::cout << x  // has side effect of printing value of x to console, evaluates to std::cout
```
## Key insight  
Wherever a single value is expected in C++, you can use an value-producing expression instead, and the expression will be evaluated to produce a single value. 



Expressions do not end in a semicolon, and cannot be compiled by themselves. For example, if you were to try compiling the expression `x = 5`, your compiler would complain (probably about a missing semicolon). Rather, expressions are always evaluated as part of statements.


```
int x{ 2 + 3 }; // 2 + 3 is an expression that has no semicolon -- the semicolon is at the end of the statement containing the expression
```
For example, take this statement: 
type identifier { expression };

_type_ could be any valid type (we chose `int`). _identifier_ could be any valid name (we chose `x`). And _expression_ could be any valid expression (we chose `2 + 3`, which uses two literals and an operator).
