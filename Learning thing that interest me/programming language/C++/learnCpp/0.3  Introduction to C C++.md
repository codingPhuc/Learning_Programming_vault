The  C  language was developed in 1972  by  Dennis Ritches  at Bell Telephone laboratories ,primarily as as system  programming language (a language to write operation system with) 
Ritches primary goal was to a developed a programming language that was  easy to compile  , efficient in memory access , product effecient amount of code  
C end up being so efficient that Ritches rewrite most of the Unix operating system in C . Many pervious operating system was written in assembly . Due to this , these operating system was not portable and require additional configuration when ported to another system.  As a result , C and Unix have their fortunes ties together 

C++ 
C++(pronounced "see plus plus") was  developed  by  Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell labs as an extension to C , starting in  1979 . C ++  is regraded as a superset of C. What most notable about C++  is it ability to used OOP  
C++ was standardized by the IOS committee .  The purpose of this standardization is too make C++ code consistent with all compiler 

There have been five major update to the C++ language since then  (informally named C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23) . C++ 11  have a wider functionality and is consider the baseline for the language 

## C and C++ philosophy 
The  underlying  design philosophy of C++ is trust the programmer  , which is both  wonderful and dangerous . The language will not stop you from doing thing that doesn't make sense , this is an importance reason why knowing what you shouldn't    do in C++  is like knowing what you should do  
C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few types of applications that C++ would excel in:

- Video games
- Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
- High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
- Graphical applications and simulations
- Productivity / office applications
- Embedded software
- Audio and video processing
- Artificial intelligence and neural networks
