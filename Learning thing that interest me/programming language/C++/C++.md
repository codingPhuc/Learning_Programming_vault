# main learning site 
https://www.learncpp.com/
Bjarne Stroustrup, the original creator of C++, has a book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" you can use to learn C++ and programming. I believe that to learn, books are much more comprehensive than tutorials or YT videos.
www.learncpp.com

is the best free tutorial out there. (reason) It covers everything from the absolute basics to advanced topics. It follows modern and best practice guidelines.

www.studyplan.dev/cpp is a (very) close second, even surpassing learncpp in the breath of topics covered. It covers quite a few things that learncpp does not, but does not have just as much detail/in depth explana
tions on the shared parts. Don't be fooled by the somewhat strange AI generated images. The author just had a little fun. Just ignore them.

 www.cppreference.com

is the best language reference out there.

 Stay away from

•	⁠cplusplus.com (reason)
•	⁠w3schools (reason)
•	⁠geeks-for-geeks (reason)
•	⁠Tutorialspoint (reason)
•	⁠educba.com (reason)
•	⁠thinkcpp (reason)
•	⁠javaTpoint (reason)
•	⁠studyfied (not even a tutorial, just a collection of code by random people)
•	⁠codevisionz (reason)
•	⁠sololearn (reason)

Again. The above are bad tutorials that you should NOT use.

 Sites that used to be on this list, but no longer are:

•	⁠Programiz has significantly improved. Its not perfect yet, but definitely not to be avoided any longer.(reason)

 Most youtube tutorials are of low quality, I would recommend to stay away from them as well. A notable exception are the CppCon Back to Basics videos. They are good, topic oriented and in depth explanations. However, they assume that you have some knowledge of the language's basic features and syntax and as such aren't a good entry point into the language.

If you really insist on videos, then take a look at this list.

As a tutorial www.learncpp.com is just better than any other resource.

 Written by u/IyeOnline. This may get updates over time if something changes or I write more scathing reviews of other tutorials :) .

The author is not affiliated with any of the mentioned tutorials.

I've picked it up mostly through books, podcasts, and reading through the code I'm working on.

Books:
A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrop

My apologies that there aren't direct courses or guides here. As said before, I've learned what I needed as I've gone along


I really liked C++ Crash Course, not really project based but it's packed with good information

Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series is great if you'd like to learn graphics while also practicing your C++ skills. The ray tracer it has you design looks fantastic

ChiliTomatoNoodle has hours of free advanced C++ content. Also has stuff like game and graphics programming.

# embedded 

do projects you enjoy, it's more about having a goal and learning the in between on the way to your goal

Find an embedded product or gadget idea and go for it, it's more interesting and will be worth more on your CV to have prototypes of few ideas
I recommend you to start from the Atmega328P. This is the microcontroller in the Arduino. You can grab a book written by Elliot Williams called MAKE: AVR Programming. You can go a long distance with this book and I have learn a lot personally.

In addition to this, you can write the code in the same IDE you used for Arduino. But you need to do some modifications to work the way you want and you can find lots and lots of related videos in the web.

I'm doing a post grad degree for embedded systems and right now I'm working with "Introduction to Embedded Systems: Using ANSI C and the Arduino Development Environment" from David Russell. I've only worked through a couple of pages, but it seems interesting to me, as he takes a well documented uC and circumvents the capsuling of the IDE with Standard C methods. The examples come in "standard" Arduino code and ANSI C, so that you can easily comprehend how the code works.

## Computer vision 


https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-vision-with-embedded-machine-learning 



## Project



I wouldn’t worry too much about trying to have your projects be unique - odds are good that anything you want to do, many people have done before. If they haven’t then they’re probably too complicated to be good choices for starting learning.

Just keep it simple as you start experimenting. Like someone else suggested, try controlling an LED. Try reading a temperature sensor. Try controlling a servo. Try reading a switch or potentiometer and using that to control an LED or servo. If you start out with “machine learning person vs package vs animal detection” on an ESP32CAM or web server that dynamically updates pages from a fleet of sensors, you’re going to hate your life.

Embedded programming environments are very, very different from Linux/Windows/macOS. They’re highly resource constrained - very little memory, very little persistent storage, slow CPUs. A lot of things we take for granted you’ll have to be explicitly aware of and manage by hand. What languages are you familiar with now? If they’re Python, JavaScript/Node, Ruby, Swift, or similar you’re in for a shock when you start programming in C. Even if you’re used to C++ or C#, a lot of convenience and utility functionality in those languages isn’t available or just shouldn’t be used in embedded environments due to resource constraints.

If you’re learning C as part of this journey you can do a lot in a more comfortable environment like Linux. You won’t have the resource constraints but you can still shoot yourself in the foot, just more quickly, which is good because you’ll be doing it a lot (and don’t get discouraged by that, it happens to everyone, even people with decades of experience in C). Learning C in that environment won’t teach you about embedded programming but it will still help you since you’ll almost certainly be programming embedded devices in C.

## interview question 
There are very limited interview resources for Embedded systems. This fact becomes evident when you compare the Glassdoor interview experiences for job profiles like Software Engineer or even Data Scientist with Embedded Software / System Engineer. Due to this, many candidates go unprepared for the interviews, so the success rate is low.

My job allows me to interact with Embedded hiring managers from big tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon etc. and gather the information that can help candidates better help with their interviews. A typical interview process in FAANG companies looks something like the below.

**Initial Phone Screening**  
**>** A discussion could also be about your experience and key projects.  
> Programming questions(DSA / C), and fundamental questions related to the embedded domain.

**Virtual On-site: 4-6 Interviews**  
**>** 2-3 rounds of leetcode-style coding rounds. - Data Structures, Algorithms (LC Medium-Hard)

> 2-3 on domain knowledge from x-functional teams you are going to work with - X-functional - Embedded OS/C++/Kernal related concepts, Embedded System Design, Microcontroller Units, etc.

**Behavioural Round(On-site)**

> Questions related to your job experience, Discussions on past projects, and Open-ended questions to gauge if you're a "good fit."

Breaking the interview topics down into the topic level to give you a better idea.

**DSA**  
> Companies like Google and Amazon like to ask DSA questions in the interviews. It could in the phone screen or during the virtual on-site interviews. The most important topics of you will be - Arrays, String, Bit manipulation, LinkedList and pointers. You can refer to platforms like leetcode and solve Medium and some Hard level questions.

> If you have time you can practice a few questions basic questions on Trees, Graphs and Dynamic programming. No need to go into every detail.  
**Listing down a few more important topics in Embedded Domain -**

**Embedded System Design**  
Design for Resilience and testability, Resource Constraints of Embedded Systems, Finite State Machines, Resilience and Performance of Embedded Systems, Logging into Embedded Systems

**Programming for Embedded Devices - Embedded C**

Bit Manipulation - Embedded specific use cases, Byte Ordering, Pointers, Number Representation, Aggregate Data Types, Efficient Coding

**Microcontroller Units**

ARM-Cortex Architecture, Modern CPU Architecture, Registers and Modes, Interrupts and Exceptions, Memory Layout, Calling Convention, and Code Execution, Power Save

**Embedded OS**

Booting, Security Issues in Boot Loaders, U-Boot, Exceptions, Concurrency and Synchronization, Critical Section and Shared Resources, InterProcess Synchronisation and Communication, Reentrancy  
In the end, clearing interviews are just going to be about practice, practice practice - There is no shortcut for practice but there could be an efficient way of doing practice.  
If you’re unsure about how to start your prep for your next Embedded Software Engineering, let Interview Kickstart be your guide. As pioneers in the [field of technical interview prep](https://www.interviewkickstart.com/courses/embedded-software-engineering-interview-masterclass/?utm_source=Reddit_PM&utm_medium=O9&utm_campaign=post&utm_term=want_to_work_at_faang_but_for_embedded_so_what_do&utm_content=), we have trained hundreds of experienced engineers to crack the toughest interviews and land jobs at their dream companies, like Google & Apple.

If you wish to know more you can check out my answer here on quora for the typical FAANG interview questions that can use to practice.

[https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-job-interview-questions-for-an-embedded-system-engineer-at-FAANG-companies/answer/Abhinav-Rawat-11](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-job-interview-questions-for-an-embedded-system-engineer-at-FAANG-companies/answer/Abhinav-Rawat-11)
'm not someone doing embedded systems in FAANG, but I interviewed for entry-level positions with Apple, Facebook Reality Labs (before they became Reality Labs), and Microsoft before rejecting an offer from Apple to go back to graduate school for a PhD. There was an incredible amount of variation between the interview cycles at Apple, especially since I interviewed with multiple teams and it felt like every team had its own way of doing things. Usually, the recruiter will do an excellent job of telling you *exactly* what to expect though. I experienced the recruiters being quite helpful in this way at Apple and FRL, but the Microsoft one was a lot less helpful. I *strongly* recommend checking out Glassdoor or Blind (anonymous professional network, some of which is public and has some useful interview-related information).

I'll describe two interview loops at Apple, one interview loop at Reality Labs, and one interview loop at Microsoft.

Apple Interview Loop #1: First round involved an informal phone screen with a recruiter and a more formal, technical phone screen with a member of an embedded systems team that worked on haptics at Apple (within the HID group I believe). This was followed by a some take-home assignments, one that was designing a basic program (which I had to also test) that involved sorting and manipulating data structures such as arrays and another that involved looking at ~200 lines of existing code and figuring out where mistakes or undesirable coding practices have taken place. This was then followed by another technical phone screen with the same member of the team from before, and talking through both assignments. This was then followed by an all-day interview that entailed questions about haptics, questions about timing in various aspects of embedded systems, component selection, basic programming problems involving various data types, signed and unsigned, some compiler trivia, basic communication protocols, and questions related to basic circuits involved pull-ups, pull-downs, op amps, and so on. All coding portions were done in coderpad if I remember correctly. This all felt extremely tailored to the particular role at Apple. This was the loop that I got an offer from.

Apple Interview Loop #2: Similar to the first loop with the haptics team - started with an informal phone screen and then a more formal, technical phone screen with a member from a different team that I believe did something related to MacOS software. This was then followed by a Leetcode-like round in coderpad, which went rather terribly since I ended up fixating on the wrong parts of the problem (I honestly don't even remember the problem at this point) and wasted a lot of time. I wasn't asked to proceed with the loop.

Reality Labs Interview Loop: Began with a technical phone screen with a recruiter, though it didn't really feel technical at all. I was asked questions about my resume and then some generic questions about specific things that I'm sure the recruiter just had written down somewhere, such as what specific communication protocols like I2C or SPI entailed. This was followed by a technical phone screen + coderpad-like website that revolved around a question that felt like a Leetcode hard and involved probably the least well-meaning interviewer I've ever had. The question itself revolved around manipulating a portion of a filesystem (think something like SPIFFS) to fit certain requirements. Nevertheless, somehow got "positive" feedback and was invited to a two day "interview fair" that basically involved me showing up at a certain time slot to get interviewed in a round-robin fashion. This went rather poorly since I didn't really prepare for it, but it consisted of mostly Leetcode easy-medium type questions, questions for drawing out how certain signals would look, how to debug in certain scenarios (with and without an impressive debugger + IDE combination), questions I would ask EEs designing the hardware when working with them, and schematic drawings of basic sub-systems based on a datasheet.

Microsoft Interview Loop: This was for the Azure group at Microsoft, specifically for writing embedded software for custom silicon designed by Microsoft. It started out with an initial technical screening over Microsoft Teams that involved ~20 minutes of rambling about Microsoft, ~15 minutes of targeted questions based on my resume, and the remaining ~25 minutes toward a Leetcode-style question (probably a Leetcode medium) involving a circular queue (or a ring buffer). This was followed by a 45 minute interview over Microsoft Teams that involved more targeted questions about embedded systems in datacenters, common communication protocols, experience working with distributed teams, and a few questions that honestly felt like systems design questions out of nowhere. I didn't proceed with the remainder of this loop even though the recruiter peppered me with emails about next steps since I had already decided at this point I wanted to go back to graduate school.

### **Summary of Embedded System Design Interviews in MAANG+ Companies**

System design questions are among the most challenging aspects of embedded system engineering interviews, especially in MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and other tier-1 tech companies. These questions are designed to test candidates' ability to navigate ambiguity and apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.

### **Common Embedded System Design Questions:**

- **State Machine Designs:** Vending machines, traffic light controllers
- **Product Design:** Oculus game controller, VR glasses, Apple Pencil, Audio Mixer (Facebook Reality Lab)
- **Software Architecture:** Microkernel-based system for file execution (Facebook Reality Lab)
- **Data Communication:** Protocol to send data from host to device in chunks (Facebook)
- **Telemetry & Sensors:** Telemetry Service (Facebook), Throwable Panoramic Ball Camera for 360° photos
- **IoT & Smart Systems:** Smart garden watering system with multiple zones

### **Insights from Candidates & Engineers:**

- Interviews often include **LeetCode-style algorithm problems**, though many argue they aren't always relevant for embedded development.
- **Amazon and Google interviews** can feel disconnected from embedded work, focusing more on leadership principles or generic coding challenges.
- **Meta's AR/VR division** appears more aligned with embedded system-focused questions.
- Some candidates express **ethical concerns** regarding certain companies and their business practices.
