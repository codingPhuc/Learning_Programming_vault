# how does function work 
function help with preventing the repetition of code 
function have : 
- function name 
- function parameter 
ex : a function that turn different ingredient into cake 

```
function sum(number1 , number2)
{
var result = number1 + number2  
return result 
}
```

first button is step over the current point 
the second is step over a function 
third is step into a function 
forth is step out of a function 
fifth is step into the next function call in a chain link

## why used debugger 
there is situation that debugger will be useful like when a function in another function , or when you executing a chain function 
# best practice 
c= a+b 
- this is not good code 
- variable to loosely define 
result = number1 + number2 
- clearly define varible
- easy to understand and work with
