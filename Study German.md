1. The first thing I would do is learn the rules for pronouncing German words based on their written forms and learn how to pronounce any phonemes and allophones that don't occur in any languages you already speak. I find it much easier to remember vocabulary when you can put sound to the spelling and vice versa. This also allows you to practice various sentence structures out loud and start developing a sense of how German sentences sound. Luckily, [German orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography) is pretty phonemic: The pronunciation can pretty much always be determined from the spelling, although the converse is not always true.
    
2. The next thing I would do is learn the basic parts of speech that exist in German and what grammatical categories they inflect for. You don't need to learn all of the inflections now - that will be an ongoing process for most of your German-learning career - but knowing that nouns have one of three grammatical genders, that verbs conjugate for person, etc. is important.
    
3. Learn the most basic syntax rules. I would consider these to be the basic determiner-adjective-noun structure of noun phrases and German's famous [V2 word order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order). At this point, you should be able to construct very simple sentences.
    
4. Learn some basic vocabulary. Good places to start are common functional lexemes and lexemes that would be used in basic greetings and to introduce oneself. From here on, you will need to balance learning more and more vocabulary with learning the rest of the grammar.
    
5. Study the nominative case. As you introduce each case, learn when it's used, the grammatical function it serves, the adjective endings and forms of the definite and indefinite articles that are used with that case, and the personal pronouns in that case. At this point, you should be able to construct simple yet properly inflected noun phrases in the nominative case.
    
6. Learn the verb conjugations for person and number in the _Präsens_ verb tense (present indicative).
    
7. Study the accusative case. At this point, you should be able to construct simple sentences in the present indicative with direct objects.
    
8. Learn the two main options for referring to the past in German, the _Perfekt_ and the _Präteritum_, and how they are used. Learn how to construct the _Perfekt_, how to construct a _Partizip Perfekt_ for a given verb, and the word order of a sentence in the _Perfekt_.
    
9. Learn the two main options for referring to the future in German, the _Präsens_ and the _Futur I_, and how they are used. Learn how to construct the _Futur I_ and the word order of a sentence in the _Futur I_.
    

Hopefully, that's enough to keep you busy for a while. Obviously, the order of these things isn't fixed, but this seems like a logical start to me.
