# What is React Native

React Native is a popular framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create mobile apps that can run on both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase.

## Key Features

1. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Write once, run anywhere
   - Native components for both iOS and Android
   - Platform-specific code when needed

2. **JavaScript & React**
   - Uses familiar React concepts
   - Large ecosystem of libraries
   - Active community support

3. **Native Performance**
   - Direct mapping to native UI components
   - Native APIs access
   - Bridge for native modules

## Advantages

- **Code Reusability**: Share code between platforms
- **Fast Development**: Hot reloading, quick iterations
- **Native Experience**: True native UI components
- **Large Community**: Extensive resources and libraries
- **Cost-Effective**: Single team for both platforms

## Limitations

- **Platform Differences**: Some features require platform-specific code
- **Performance**: Complex animations might need native implementation
- **Bundle Size**: Initial app size can be larger
- **Native Module Updates**: Dependency on native module updates

## Use Cases

- **MVP Development**: Quick prototyping
- **Cross-Platform Apps**: Consistent experience across platforms
- **Content-Driven Apps**: News, social media, etc.
- **Business Apps**: Enterprise applications

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites
   - Node.js
   - npm or yarn
   - Code editor (VS Code recommended)
   - Platform-specific tools

2. Installation
   ```bash
   npx react-native init MyApp
   ```

3. Running
   ```bash
   cd MyApp
   npx react-native run-ios    # For iOS
   npx react-native run-android # For Android
   ```
