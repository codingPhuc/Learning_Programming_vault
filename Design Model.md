## why do developer need to draw the box again even thought there is already a design ? 
- we need to check if there is any similarity between the items , if there is then group them together 
- help in defining class for each object , items  that is similar

4 layer of a box model  :  
Margin  >Border > Padding > Content  
Margin + Border + Padding all have (top right left and bottom) 
while Content can change element width  and height
