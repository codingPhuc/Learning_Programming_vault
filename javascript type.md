number 
![[Drawing 2024-06-29 22.34.06.excalidraw]]
the reason why we need type for reasoning and definition of data 
Example think that you have bucket and do not know what liquid is in that bucket ? 
so type help with identifying the liquid inside the bucket 
when a string type interact with a  number type bases on the operation interaction it will product different result 
- "23" +25 ->  "2325" in a + operation string will be prioritize 
- "23" - 25 -> -2 in a - operation number will be prioritize 
boolen have two different type assignable  value  true and false 
```
var  male = true 
var  female = false 
```
undefine the type does not exit 
```
var undefine , 
```
null is a special value with empty variable 
```
var nullValue = null 
```
nan -> is not a number value 
```
var age =  "23" 
number(age) = 23
var height = "1m73"
number(height) = NAN
```
object are element that collect other element 
```
var duy {name : "duy"
age : 25
} 
```
each line in the object is a value
