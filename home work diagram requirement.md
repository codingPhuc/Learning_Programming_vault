### Activity Diagram Outline

For each function, you can create an activity diagram with the following elements:

1. **Start**: Indicate the start of the process.
2. **Receive Request**: Show the reception of the HTTP request.
3. **Extract and Validate Token**: Extract and validate the bearer token.
4. **Connect to Database**: Connect to the MongoDB database.
5. **Perform Operation**: Perform the specific operation (add, get, update, delete).
6. **Respond**: Send the appropriate response back to the client.
7. **End**: Indicate the end of the process.

This structure should help you create detailed activity diagrams for each function in the [`index.js`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FLearning%20programming%20language%20valut%20%2B%20project%2Fhomework%2FtoDoApp%2FbackEndTodoApp%2Fserver%2Fcontrollers%2Ftasks%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22b61de79a-c8c3-48db-994d-3ee07fcb888e%22%5D "d:\Learning programming language valut + project\homework\toDoApp\backEndTodoApp\server\controllers\tasks\index.js") file.
