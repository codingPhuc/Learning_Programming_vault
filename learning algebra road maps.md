## Motivation and New Knowledge

- **Paul's motivation:**
    - Finding new connections, pure curiosity, and academic research.
- 50% of new cards are **connections derived from old knowledge**, allowing the system to generate new insights.

## Transition from Algorithms to Reasoning

- Early math education emphasizes repetitive drills to solidify computational skills.
- As math becomes abstract (college-level or beyond), focus shifts to creative reasoning and problem-solving.

## Study Tips

1. Study in the right environment.
    - Quiet. You need to be able to think deeply to learn Mathematics. A noisy environment creates obstacles to your concentration and creates distractions to focusing on the problems at hand.
    - Well-supplied. Have plenty of scratch paper, graph paper, pencils, and erasers handy. Colored pencils are also useful. A scientific calculator is also useful.
    - Well-lit. Make sure there is good lighting while reading and studying.
    - Study groups. If you are the type of person who learns well in a social environment, try joining or forming a study group.
2. Do your Math homework before homework in other subjects.
    - You will be working when your mind is sharpest.
    - If you get stuck on a problem, you can revisit it later.
    - You have time to get help on problems that you have no idea about.
3. Take study breaks.
    - After a period of concentration, take a break for relaxation or to work on other subjects.
    - Return to problems that you could not complete previously.
4. Study outside of class regularly.
    - Work on your Math homework or study your Math every day.
    - Study your Math at least two hours for each hour in the classroom. For example, a four-unit class will require at least 8 hours of study per week.
5. Read your textbooks. See [reading Math textbooks](https://missioncollege.edu/depts/math/math-help/how-to-study-math/reading-textbooks.html) for details.
6. Get good at taking notes in class. See [note-taking](https://missioncollege.edu/depts/math/math-help/how-to-study-math/note-taking-for-college.html "taking notes") for more details.
7. Make summary sheets.
    - Make a list of important theorems.
    - Make a list of important properties and formulas.
    - Make a list of important vocabulary words.
    - Make a list of the important course objectives for each unit in the course (usually a section or chapter of the textbook).
    - Review these lists every day.
8. Practice all problems until you have mastered the ability to solve and check them.
9. Be aware of what topics you know well, which topics need more practice, and which topics you don't know at all.
10. Continually review: Review material from the beginning of the semester throughout the entire semester.

## Key Considerations

- **Depth of Understanding:** While it's possible to grasp basic algebraic concepts quickly, achieving a deep and thorough understanding typically requires more time and practice.
    [School Yourself](https://blog.schoolyourself.org/2015/06/can-you-learn-algebra-in-24-hours.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Consistency:** Regular practice and consistent study habits are crucial for mastering algebraic topics.
- **Individual Factors:** Prior mathematical background, learning style, and the complexity of topics influence the time needed to learn these subjects.

## Proof

Proof is the foundation of mathematics. Read the proof section in the Obsidian vault for future clarification. To repetition a proof in mathematics, I should:
1. Repetition by providing the name of the proof then let the user of the proof solve it themselves.
2. Repetition by filling in the gap in the proof equation.
3. Repetition by specifying using what formula for the proof itself.
4. The proof should be separated into different sections of a course. For example, Algebra should have Preliminaries.

### Basic Recall Card

- **Front:** "What is the proof of [Theorem Name]?"
- **Back:** Full proof.

### Fill-in-the-Gaps Card

- **Front:** Incomplete proof with blanks (e.g., missing steps, formulas).
- **Back:** Completed proof.

### Formula-Based Card

- **Front:** "Which formula is used in proving [Theorem Name]?"
- **Back:** Relevant formula and explanation.

### Categorized by Topic

- Use tags in Anki to separate proofs by subjects (e.g., Algebra → Preliminaries).

### Proofs Require Practice

- Proofs are fundamentally creative and require a different approach compared to computational math.
- Work on understanding the structure of mathematics, not just memorizing proofs.
- Practice writing proofs regularly and seek feedback to improve clarity and conciseness.

## Practice

Practice is the part for solving an equation. Practice is the use of the proof to solve an equation.
1. Repetition practice: I should give equations to solve.
    - Each equation belongs to a specific section like this section is about Preliminaries.
    - Then for a single day, there will be 2 questions from a section in the Anki test. For example, today Anki will give me 40 equations I will need to solve, and there are 5 Preliminaries equations in that.
    - There should be a separation of tests too if needed. For example, 40 equations for the first test, the second test will also be 40 equations but I know which test I am currently doing.

### Problem-Solving Cards

- **Front:** "Solve: [Equation]"
- **Back:** Step-by-step solution.

### Daily Practice Setup

- Set up an Anki deck with 40 questions per day.
- Use tags to separate sections (e.g., Preliminaries, Algebra).
- Mix questions from different sections within the daily review.

### Test Mode

- Create separate decks for different test sessions.
- Label each test session clearly (e.g., "Test 1: Algebra Preliminaries").
- Ensure each test deck has 40 questions.

## Repetition in Learning


## Abstraction

- **Goal:** Maximize applicability of knowledge by climbing the ladder of abstraction.
- Proofs should be incrementally reformulated over time to reflect increasing understanding.

## Rewriting and Symbol Creation

- **Rewrite proofs in your own terms** to build an interconnected network of knowledge.
- Connections simplify knowledge over time.
- **Create custom math symbols** for different branches to avoid overlap and interference.

## Refactoring Patterns

- **Beginner errors:** Cards that are too long.
- **Improved approach:**
    - Keep cards short and semantic.
    - Add new abstractions, connections, and conceptions through reformulation.

## Applying Spaced Repetition to Mathematics

**Talk Summary by Paul Robert Shaw**  
**Date:** February 20, 2021  
**Event:** supermemory.wiki Discord

### Introduction

- The video summarizes Paul Robert Shaw's talk, as the original was not recorded.
- Purpose: Share Paul's insights and encourage him to create his own article or video on the subject.
- **About Paul:**
    - French quantum physicist.
    - 6 years of experience using spaced repetition systems (SRS), specifically **Memozyne**.
    - Dedicates 2–3 hours daily to reviewing, reformulating cards, and making connections.
    - Consistently uses SRS without breaks due to his passion for the process.
    - Has theorems and proofs at his fingertips as a result of this method.

### Core Principles

- **The 20 Rules of Knowledge Formulation** (by Piotr Wozniak):
    - These rules **do apply to math**, contrary to common belief.
    - Paul initially made formulation errors but improved over time.
    - Key takeaway: Math knowledge **can be retained** effectively with SRS.

### Atomicity

- **Definition:** Cards should represent single, simple concepts and avoid unnecessary information.
- Paul’s approach:
    - Proofs are short (6–8 lines max).
    - **Closed cards:** Only one line of a proof is closed to maintain simplicity and focus.
    - Time spent per card is comparable to vocabulary cards in language learning.

### Recursive Decomposition of Proofs

- Based on **Leslie Lamport's "How to Write a Proof"**:
    - Break down long proofs into **sub-proofs** and **sub-proofs of sub-proofs**.
    - Reduces unnecessary information and improves comprehension.
    - Enables reuse of sub-proofs, creating a **network of interconnected knowledge**.

### Drills as a Warm-Up

- Short, repetitive exercises can help reinforce familiarity with basic tools (e.g., sets, matrices, random variables).
- Example: "Which pairs of vectors are orthogonal?" or "Find determinants of these matrices."

### Flashcards and Fact Cards

- Flashcards might help in the short term but aren't as effective for advanced mathematics because concepts are interrelated.
- Instead, focus on solving problems where facts are applied in context.

### Method 1: Custom Study (Manual Control)

1. **Create a deck** that contains all your questions.
2. **Use tags** to categorize questions (e.g., `Preliminaries`, `Algebra`, etc.).
3. **Custom Study Session:**
    - Click on the deck → Click **Custom Study** → Select **"Limit to particular tags"**
    - Choose the number of questions from each tag (e.g., 5 from `Preliminaries`, 10 from `Algebra`).
    - This needs to be done manually each day.

### Method 2: Using a Filtered Deck (Automated)

1. Create multiple **filtered decks** with a specific number of questions per tag.
2. Example query for a filtered deck:
    `tag:Preliminaries limit:5`
    This will create a deck with 5 questions from the `Preliminaries` tag.
3. Do the same for each category and merge them into your daily study.

### Method 3: Using Anki Add-ons for More Control

1. **"Filtered Decks with Tag and Limit"** (Custom add-ons allow setting specific numbers per tag).
2. **"Advanced Review Scheduler"** (Some add-ons let you control how many questions appear from each tag).

## Amount of Time

### Time Commitment

- Beginners: 14-20 weeks (3 hours/day, 5 days/week).
- With some gaps: ~2 months.
- Intensive study: Some individuals completed algebra through precalculus in a month by dedicating a chapter per night.

### College Courses

- At the community college level, introductory algebra courses often run for about 18 weeks. These courses may progress more rapidly than high school classes.

### Self-Directed Learning

- **Pacing:** Self-learners can adjust their study pace based on personal goals and available time. Some individuals have reported progressing from Algebra I to Calculus II within a year through dedicated self-study.
    [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sm2U3vyL4w&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Resources:** Utilizing comprehensive resources like Khan Academy or structured textbooks can facilitate accelerated learning. For instance, some learners have completed high school math curricula in 3 to 6 months through intensive study.

### Formal Education Timeline

- **High School Curriculum:** In the United States, the sequence typically includes Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and Pre-Calculus, each spanning an academic year. This sequence usually takes four years, starting with Algebra I in 8th or 9th grade and culminating with Pre-Calculus in 11th or 12th grade.

## Challenges in Learning

### Be Persistent

- Even if a topic feels insurmountable (e.g., Representation Theory, Real Analysis), persistence and time often lead to improvement.
- Accept that setbacks are part of the learning process in math.

### Individual Strengths in Math Vary

- You might excel in computation-heavy courses (e.g., Calculus) but struggle with abstract courses (e.g., Linear Algebra), or vice versa.
- Different people excel at different areas of mathematics.

### Seek Support

- Regularly attend office hours to understand what your proofs are missing.
- Engage with professors or peers to clarify concepts and receive guidance.

### Transition to Advanced Math Takes Time

- Moving from computation-based courses (e.g., Calculus) to proof-based courses (e.g., Linear Algebra) is challenging for everyone.
- Be patient with yourself—it’s a new skill that improves with experience.

### Learning Curve is Normal

- Feeling like you’ve “hit a wall” is part of learning advanced math. This feeling often happens as concepts become more abstract.
- Over time, you’ll look back and realize you’ve progressed further than you thought.

### Challenges of Forgetting

- Forgetting foundational facts, like properties of orthogonality or matrices, is normal.
- Instead of relying heavily on drills, it’s better to review gaps as they arise and keep moving forward.

### Philosophy for Advanced Study

- Everyone forgets! It’s okay to revisit old concepts, refresh briefly, and continue building understanding.
- Drills serve as foundational warm-ups, but deeper learning often comes from engaging with challenging problems and reasoning exercises.

## Key Resources

### Software Recommendations

- While Paul uses **SuperMemo** for other knowledge types, he recommends:
    - **Anki** or **Memozyne** for math, due to their **LaTeX support**.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Incremental reformulation of cards.
        - Parent-note edits propagate to child closes for efficient batch editing.

### Choose the Right Resources

- The textbook and course design matter—some courses assume prior exposure to proofs.
- Revisiting the material with a better foundation in analysis or algebra might help.

### Advice

- Look into resources specific to College Algebra if that’s the goal.
- Worksheets, problem sets, and syllabi help guide focus.
- Breaks and gradual exposure build long-term understanding.

### Study Methods

- Platforms like Khan Academy, Udemy, and textbooks are common.
- Regular problem-solving and practice are critical to grasp abstract concepts.
