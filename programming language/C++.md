Bjarne Stroustrup, the original creator of C++, has a book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" you can use to learn C++ and programming. I believe that to learn, books are much more comprehensive than tutorials or YT videos.
www.learncpp.com

is the best free tutorial out there. (reason) It covers everything from the absolute basics to advanced topics. It follows modern and best practice guidelines.

www.studyplan.dev/cpp is a (very) close second, even surpassing learncpp in the breath of topics covered. It covers quite a few things that learncpp does not, but does not have just as much detail/in depth explana
tions on the shared parts. Don't be fooled by the somewhat strange AI generated images. The author just had a little fun. Just ignore them.

 www.cppreference.com

is the best language reference out there.

 Stay away from

•	⁠cplusplus.com (reason)
•	⁠w3schools (reason)
•	⁠geeks-for-geeks (reason)
•	⁠Tutorialspoint (reason)
•	⁠educba.com (reason)
•	⁠thinkcpp (reason)
•	⁠javaTpoint (reason)
•	⁠studyfied (not even a tutorial, just a collection of code by random people)
•	⁠codevisionz (reason)
•	⁠sololearn (reason)

Again. The above are bad tutorials that you should NOT use.

 Sites that used to be on this list, but no longer are:

•	⁠Programiz has significantly improved. Its not perfect yet, but definitely not to be avoided any longer.(reason)

 Most youtube tutorials are of low quality, I would recommend to stay away from them as well. A notable exception are the CppCon Back to Basics videos. They are good, topic oriented and in depth explanations. However, they assume that you have some knowledge of the language's basic features and syntax and as such aren't a good entry point into the language.

If you really insist on videos, then take a look at this list.

As a tutorial www.learncpp.com is just better than any other resource.

I've picked it up mostly through books, podcasts, and reading through the code I'm working on.

Books:
A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrop

C++ Best Practices by Jason Turner

Youtube:

C++ Weekly

Podcast:

CPPCast


My apologies that there aren't direct courses or guides here. As said before, I've learned what I needed as I've gone along


I really liked C++ Crash Course, not really project based but it's packed with good information

Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series is great if you'd like to learn graphics while also practicing your C++ skills. The ray tracer it has you design looks fantastic

ChiliTomatoNoodle has hours of free advanced C++ content. Also has stuff like game and graphics programming.

# embedded 

do projects you enjoy, it's more about having a goal and learning the in between on the way to your goal

Find an embedded product or gadget idea and go for it, it's more interesting and will be worth more on your CV to have prototypes of few ideas
I recommend you to start from the Atmega328P. This is the microcontroller in the Arduino. You can grab a book written by Elliot Williams called MAKE: AVR Programming. You can go a long distance with this book and I have learn a lot personally.

In addition to this, you can write the code in the same IDE you used for Arduino. But you need to do some modifications to work the way you want and you can find lots and lots of related videos in the web.

I'm doing a post grad degree for embedded systems and right now I'm working with "Introduction to Embedded Systems: Using ANSI C and the Arduino Development Environment" from David Russell. I've only worked through a couple of pages, but it seems interesting to me, as he takes a well documented uC and circumvents the capsuling of the IDE with Standard C methods. The examples come in "standard" Arduino code and ANSI C, so that you can easily comprehend how the code works.

I would recommend an electrosmith daisy. They have a built in analog/ digital converter. It also has a built in library with delay lines and other usable methods. It is coded in c or c++. Hope this helps, let me know if you need any more information.

## interview question 
### **Summary of Embedded System Design Interviews in MAANG+ Companies**

System design questions are among the most challenging aspects of embedded system engineering interviews, especially in MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and other tier-1 tech companies. These questions are designed to test candidates' ability to navigate ambiguity and apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.

### **Common Embedded System Design Questions:**

- **State Machine Designs:** Vending machines, traffic light controllers
- **Product Design:** Oculus game controller, VR glasses, Apple Pencil, Audio Mixer (Facebook Reality Lab)
- **Software Architecture:** Microkernel-based system for file execution (Facebook Reality Lab)
- **Data Communication:** Protocol to send data from host to device in chunks (Facebook)
- **Telemetry & Sensors:** Telemetry Service (Facebook), Throwable Panoramic Ball Camera for 360° photos
- **IoT & Smart Systems:** Smart garden watering system with multiple zones

### **Insights from Candidates & Engineers:**

- Interviews often include **LeetCode-style algorithm problems**, though many argue they aren't always relevant for embedded development.
- **Amazon and Google interviews** can feel disconnected from embedded work, focusing more on leadership principles or generic coding challenges.
- **Meta's AR/VR division** appears more aligned with embedded system-focused questions.
- Some candidates express **ethical concerns** regarding certain companies and their business practices.

[This thread on Reddit lists](https://old.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/bqoqpr/what_are_some_more_obscure_interview_questions/eo6t7gc/) down some more interview questions for Embedded.  
[This post on leetcode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/974067/nda-microsoft-amazon-senior-software-engineer-embedded-software-india-offers) discusses the Embedded interview process at Amazon and Microsoft in great detail.

I hope these resources will help you.
