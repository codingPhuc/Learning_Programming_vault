bases on those  pick a subsect of C++  bases on your application  
the power of teaching thought automatic test 
writing the test first that define what you trying to solve in the code  learn 1 thing  at time instead of trying to understand the rules 
it require a few thing coach that will explain  
1. understanding what problem you are trying to solve picking a subsect and thing about 

write a code to csv file they suggle with and learn about it then do a code  review they are very unhappy with it 

imagine a very simple project take it from beginning and try to write it out and come up with more complex senario there is very good book on test driven development the good thing language that write test is samller subset than language for implementing 
embedded system there is a very big thing to set up always find program 
slag group for software crafe there is channel for that this will get you start doing pair programming  
which level are you going to optimize ?  
thing like game can be leave a little bit of game

how to practice these stuff  
puni said  that C++ compiler is  not as good as rust 
rust does not have inherietence 
model is running on the C++ century of translating in C++ 
memory safty on C++
