## Ba Thu
She said that we were childish:
- The dead air seems to be a lot.
- Keep on saying "yes, yes" whenever they explain something.
  - It is better to just connect the conversation and explain the topic they are talking about.
- When we talk, there seems to be disinterest followed by a sense of tiredness, which keeps us from listening to other information, causing us to not focus on the conversation.

## Wibu
He said that we were quite like someone who stays at home all the time:
- We laugh or smile when we talk when anxious.
- Have a tone change every time we talk.
- Seem to be doing something with our hands.
- Did not pay close attention.
- When we talk, there seems to be disinterest followed by a sense of tiredness, which keeps us from listening to other information, causing us to not focus on the conversation.

## Nhan Pham
Said that we sound and talk like someone who goes to an international school:
- We have talked with them on 2 occasions.
- Both times, the tone of our voice seemed childish; it is loud on some parts and quiet on others.
- Is it the way we talk, the disinterest we give on a specific subject?
- The dead air which we created.
- When we talk, there seems to be disinterest followed by a sense of tiredness, which keeps us from listening to other information, causing us to not focus on the conversation.

## Conclusion
- In all three of the conversations above, I seem to be bored with what the other people talk and explain. This boredom causes me to not listen to what they are saying or care about them in general.
- The dead air seems to be the cause.
- My inability to tell a story or to improve upon their idea is the main cause.

## Plan of Action
1. I will speak and talk to ChatGPT with a video recording my talk.
2. I will speak and talk with ChatGPT on the book "How to Influence and Make Friends with People".
3. Then I will use the conversation skills, specifically the skill to convince people, in real-life scenarios.

## Timeline
If I take 3 hours out of my day to do the above:
- Each conversation I have with ChatGPT is 30 minutes.
- Then I will have 5 conversations excluding break time.
- There will be a total of 28 exercises. The exercises will then be repeated for about 3 weeks.
- In the fourth week, that is when I will use it on real human beings.

# role play for improve conversation 

### Revised Prompt

You are tasked with generating role-playing scenarios and exercises designed to improve my conversation skills. The exercises should address specific conversational flaws, such as anxiety, and help me practice effectively. These exercises will be given to another AI to conduct the role-playing.

#### **Requirements for Role-Playing Scenarios:**

1. **Context Development:** Create realistic and engaging scenarios based on common conversational challenges, such as workplace conflicts, social interactions, or negotiations.

2. **Role Descriptions:** Clearly define the roles involved, including myself as the key participant and others to be role-played by another AI.

3. **Objectives:** Specify the goals for each scenario, such as reducing anxiety, resolving conflict, improving clarity, or building empathy.

#### **Requirements for Actionable Exercises:**

1. Design exercises aimed at addressing specific flaws like anxiety or lack of confidence.

2. Include measurable objectives and progress checkpoints within a timeline (e.g., 1 month) to help track improvement.

3. Suggest supplementary techniques or activities, such as reflection tasks, communication drills, or journaling, to reinforce learning.

#### **Example Output Format:**

**Scenario:**

- **Context:** A team meeting where I need to present my ideas but feel anxious and struggle to express myself clearly.

- **Roles:**

- Myself as the presenter.

- A supportive team member offering encouragement.

- A critical team member challenging my ideas.

- **Objectives:**

1. Practice staying calm and confident under pressure.

2. Respond constructively to criticism.

3. Clearly articulate ideas despite anxiety.

**Exercise Plan:**

1. **Preparation Drill:** Spend 10 minutes practicing deep breathing before any conversation.

2. **Role-Playing Exercise:** Conduct the above scenario, focusing on maintaining composure and clarity.

3. **Reflection Task:** After each role-play session, note down what went well and areas for improvement.

4. **Progress Checkpoints:** Set weekly milestones, such as reducing anxious pauses by 20% in 2 weeks and demonstrating consistent clarity by the end of 1 month.
