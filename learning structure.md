**Learning and Application:**

- **Time Allocation:** Dedicate a significant portion of your time to learning (10/10) , but only  40% (4/10) is spent on practical application.
- **Critical Thinking:** This skill is a cornerstone of education at many international universities and should be practiced alongside theoretical learning.

**Memory and Note-Taking:**

- **Information Retention:** Failing to remember information can lead to disappointment. Enhance memory retention by actively engaging with the material.
- **Effective Note-Taking:** Utilize techniques such as Ishikawa diagrams and iStree to structure information, which can help in developing logical thinking.
- **Memory Reliability:** Be cautious about relying solely on memory. Information tends to fade after one week unless it is revisited and reinforced.
- **Multimodal Learning:** Convert information into images and sounds to aid memory retention.

**Steps for Retaining Information:**

1. **Note Down:** Immediately write down new information to capture it effectively.
2. **Memorize:** Engage in regular review sessions to commit the information to long-term memory.

**Interdisciplinary Learning:**

- **Engineering:** Lessons are interconnected; what is learned in one session will impact future lessons.
- **Economics vs. Engineering:** Unlike economics, where concepts may be learned in isolation, engineering requires an integrated approach to learning. 

**Problem Management:**

- **Separation of Issues:** Address problems individually. Trying to solve multiple issues simultaneously can lead to panic.  
- When we made a mistake we need to take action and admit our mistake 

**Note-Taking Tools:**

- **Search Functionality:** Applications like Notion and Obsidian offer the ability to search through notes, making information retrieval more efficient


## Bloom’s Taxonomy

**Understanding the Steps:**
![[Drawing 2024-06-04 22.53.36.excalidraw|1000]]

- **Revisiting Previous Steps:** If you encounter difficulties at any stage, it’s beneficial to review earlier steps to reinforce your understanding.
- **Importance of Remembering:** The foundational step in Bloom’s Taxonomy is to remember the information, which is crucial before moving forward.
- **Progression:** Avoid rushing to the ‘Create’ stage. Ensure that all preceding steps are well understood.
- **Coursework:** SET will be helpful in mastering the top three levels of the pyramid—‘Apply,’ ‘Analyze,’ and ‘Evaluate.’
- **Repetition:** Consistently revisit the first three steps—‘Remember,’ ‘Understand,’ and ‘Apply’—to solidify your knowledge base.
- **Target Area:** Aim to reach the intermediate levels of ‘Evaluate’ and ‘Analyze’ for a deeper comprehension and ability to assess information critically.

## Learning Experience

**Learning Rate:**
![[learning exp.excalidraw]]

- **Fundamental Clarity:** A clear understanding of the basics is essential to maintain a steady learning rate.
- **Reflective Learning:** Regularly assess what might be missing from your understanding to ensure a comprehensive grasp of the subject matter.
- **Patience:** Remember that acquiring knowledge and skills takes time and effort.

## Learning Curve

**Efficient Learning:**
![[Learning Curve 2024-06-04 23.04.42.excalidraw]] 
- **Pareto Principle:** Focus on the vital 20% of content that provides the most value, as it often yields 80% of the results. This approach is particularly beneficial when aiming for scholarships or academic excellence.
- **Plateau:** Recognize the point in learning where additional knowledge doesn’t translate to increased value. This is known as a learning plateau.
- **Breakthrough:** A breakthrough occurs when a new factor or concept significantly enhances your understanding, propelling you past the plateau.

**Strategic Learning:**

- **Knowing When to Stop:** To prevent time wastage during a plateau, it’s important to evaluate the utility of knowledge. If knowledge is beneficial for 1/10 of cases, it’s worth learning. If it’s only useful for 1/100, reconsider its importance. For 1/1000, it’s likely not worth the investment.
- **Adherence to Principles:** Stick to the core principles of learning and know when to move on to more valuable topics.



## Dunning-Kruger Effect
![[Pasted image 20240604231505.png]]

**Cognitive Bias Journey:**

- **Initial Overconfidence:** As you learn more, you may experience a ‘peak of stupidity,’ where confidence is disproportionately high.
- **Realization and Despair:** This peak is often followed by a ‘valley of despair,’ where you realize the limits of your knowledge.
- **Progressive Enlightenment:** Eventually, you reach a ‘slope of enlightenment,’ where your understanding stabilizes and grows in a more measured way.

## Structure and Principles in Teams

![[Structure and Principle 2024-06-04 23.15.16.excalidraw]]

**Team Dynamics:**

- **Necessity of Structure:** Effective teams require a clear structure to function efficiently.
- **Foundation on Principles:** This structure should be built upon solid principles that guide the team’s operations and decision-making.

principle : nguyên tắc  
structure : thủ tục

## Customer Interaction in SET

**Understanding Varied Tech Knowledge:**

- **Diverse Customer Base:** In  (SET), you’ll encounter customers with varying levels of technological expertise.
- **Adaptive Communication:** Your role involves understanding and adapting to each customer’s level of tech knowledge to provide appropriate support and solutions.
