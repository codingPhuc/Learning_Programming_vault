- Taking your state's practice tests one or more times
- You will get a driving handbook and skill
-  Making flash cards from your state's driver's handbook, and then reviewing them either on your own or with someone else.
- Randomly opening your state's driver's handbook to a specific page, looking at the sign and/or picture, and writing down or explaining to yourself what it means.
- Opening your state's driver's handbook to the table of contents, then writing down as much subject matter on each section as you can remember. Then, go back and reread each section, taking notes on what all you forgot.
- Give someone else your state's driver's handbook, and have them flip through it and ask you questions about the contents. Take note of what you get wrong so that you can review and focus on those areas.

### Taking and Passing the Driving Test

If you fail to successfully complete the driving test on the first attempt, you must pay a fee for each additional driving test that is administered under an application for an original or renewal driver license.
- You may drive on your interim license (up to 60 days only) until you receive your new photo license in the mail.

### Tips with Driving Licenses
- When you're out riding with someone, take note of signs and if you cannot recall what they mean, look it up. Same with specific events - think through what you're supposed to do if you see a school bus, if two cars come to a stop sign at the same time, etc. If you were driving, do you know what you're supposed to do? If not, or if you're unsure, look it up.
- Use the vehicle you used to practice
- Proof of insurance and registration is needed for your vehicle
- The person will see if you pay attention
- You need to be able to see your surroundings for driving
- Avoid tunnel vision
- Pay close attention to the speed signs
- Watch speed in school zones
- Changing lanes incorrectly is wrong; look at the mirror
- Changing lanes requires safety
- Double turning is difficult, so you need to turn based on your lane
- Learn about the "right of way"
- Stop if there is a stop sign
