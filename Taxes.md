- **IRS Enrolled Agent Program** ([https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/become-an-enrolled-agent](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/become-an-enrolled-agent)) for deeper tax law knowledge.

- Learn about **deductions** and **credits** (e.g., standard vs. itemized deductions, child tax credit, education credits).
- Study **tax write-offs** and **business expenses** if applicable (especially if you have side income or self-employment).

#### **4. Tax Preparation Software**

- Many people use **TurboTax, TaxAct, or Free File** services to guide them through the process.

    - **Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses)**
    - **Schedule E (Rental Income & Royalties)**
    - **Retirement contributions (401k, IRA, RMDs)**

It sounds like you’re in a great position to do your own taxes since your financial situation is relatively straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### **1. Gather Your Documents**

By late January or early February, you should receive important tax documents, such as:

- **W-2 from your employer** (this reports your wages and tax withholdings).
- **1099-INT, 1099-DIV, 1099-NEC, or 1099-MISC** (if you earned interest, dividends, or side income).
- **Form 1098-E** (if you have student loan interest).
- **Other deductions/credits** (e.g., medical expenses, tuition credits, or charitable contributions).

### **2. Choose a Free Tax Filing Service**

Since your income is from a single W-2 job and you don’t have investments or self-employment income, you can likely file for free. Here are some options:

- **IRS Free File**: The IRS partners with several companies to offer free tax filing if your income is below a certain threshold. [Find options here](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free).
- **FreeTaxUSA**: A popular, affordable choice that offers free federal filing (state filing is a small fee).
- **Cash App Taxes (formerly Credit Karma Tax)**: A completely free option for both federal and state returns.

Avoid TurboTax unless necessary—it tends to push unnecessary paid services.

### **3. File Your Taxes**

- Follow the step-by-step instructions provided by the tax software.
- Most platforms will guide you to enter your W-2 info (either manually or by importing it).
- Answer questions about deductions and credits (standard deduction likely applies to you unless you have a lot of itemized deductions).
- Review your return and check for errors.
- File electronically for the fastest processing and refund (if applicable).

### **4. Understand Your Refund or Taxes Owed**

- If you had too much tax withheld from your paycheck, you’ll get a refund.
- If you didn’t have enough withheld, you might owe taxes (less common for W-2 employees).
- You can adjust your withholdings using **Form W-4** with your employer if you want to fine-tune how much tax is taken out.

### **5. Save a Copy for Your Records**

- The IRS recommends keeping tax documents for **at least 3 years** in case of an audit.
- Save a digital or printed copy of your return.

### **6. Plan for Next Year**

- If you want to optimize your tax situation, you can look into retirement contributions (e.g., 401(k), IRA) or other tax deductions for the next tax year.

Your situation is simple, and doing your own taxes will help you learn while saving money. Once you get comfortable, you’ll be able to handle more complexity in the future if needed. Let me know if you need help along the way!
