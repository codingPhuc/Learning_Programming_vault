    - Make a list of important theorems.
    - Make a list of important properties and formulas.
    - Make a list of important vocabulary words.
    - Make a list of the important course objectives for each unit in the course (usually a section or chapter of the textbook).
    - Review these lists every day. 
5. Practice all problems until you have mastered the ability to solve and check them. 
6. Be aware of what topics you know well, which topics need more practice and which topics you don't know at all. 
7. Continually review: Review material from the beginning of the semester throughout the entire semester. 
8. Do your Math homework before homework in other subjects. 
    - You will be working when your mind is sharpest.
    - If you get stuck on a problem, you can revisit it later.
    - You have time to get help on problems that you have no idea about. 
9. Take study breaks. 
    - After a period of concentration, take a break for relaxation or to work on other subjects.
    - Return to problems that you could not complete previously. 
10. Make use of campus resources.
    - The [Academic Support Center](https://missioncollege.edu/depts/academic-support/ "Academic Support Center") offers free Math tutoring (including online Math tutoring.)
    - Get involved in STEM groups on campus.

    - Well-lit. Make sure there is good lighting while reading and studying. 
    - Study groups. If you are the type of person who learns well in a social environment, try joining or forming a study group. 




This thread captures a great discussion on balancing drills and conceptual understanding in higher-level mathematics. Here's a breakdown of advice shared:

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Transition from Algorithms to Reasoning:**
    
    - Early math education emphasizes repetitive drills to solidify computational skills.
    - As math becomes abstract (college-level or beyond), focus shifts to creative reasoning and problem-solving.
2. **Challenges of Forgetting:**
    
    - Forgetting foundational facts, like properties of orthogonality or matrices, is normal.
    - Instead of relying heavily on drills, it’s better to review gaps as they arise and keep moving forward.
3. **Drills as a Warm-Up:**
    
    - Short, repetitive exercises can help reinforce familiarity with basic tools (e.g., sets, matrices, random variables).
    - Example: "Which pairs of vectors are orthogonal?" or "Find determinants of these matrices."
4. **Flashcards and Fact Cards:**
    
    - Flashcards might help in the short term but aren't as effective for advanced mathematics because concepts are interrelated.
    - Instead, focus on solving problems where facts are applied in context.
5. **Integrating Learning Tools:**
    
    - For those learning new abstractions, combining exercises, lecture notes, and small proofs can improve familiarity.
    - Online resources like [compscilib.com](https://www.compscilib.com/) provide curated practice problems for discrete math, statistics, etc.
6. **Philosophy for Advanced Study:**
    
    - Everyone forgets! It’s okay to revisit old concepts, refresh briefly, and continue building understanding.
    - Drills serve as foundational warm-ups, but deeper learning often comes from engaging with challenging problems and reasoning exercises.

### Additional Suggestions:

- **Active Recall & Spaced Repetition:** Apps like Anki can help with retaining definitions and key theorems.
- **Contextual Learning:** Engage with real-world problems or proofs that make use of the concepts you want to master.
- **Collaborate or Discuss:** Explaining concepts to peers can solidify understanding and highlight gaps.
- **Generative AI (if approached critically):** While it may produce errors, using AI tools to brainstorm or break down concepts can spark insight when used alongside verified resources.

    - **Closed cards:** Only one line of a proof is closed to maintain simplicity and focus.
    - Time spent per card is comparable to vocabulary cards in language learning.

---

## Recursive Decomposition of Proofs

- Based on **Leslie Lamport's "How to Write a Proof"**:
    - Break down long proofs into **sub-proofs** and **sub-proofs of sub-proofs**.
    - Reduces unnecessary information and improves comprehension.
    - Enables reuse of sub-proofs, creating a **network of interconnected knowledge**.

---

## Abstraction

- **Goal:** Maximize applicability of knowledge by climbing the ladder of abstraction.
- Proofs should be incrementally reformulated over time to reflect increasing understanding.

---

## Software Recommendations

- While Paul uses **SuperMemo** for other knowledge types, he recommends:
    - **Anki** or **Memozyne** for math, due to their **LaTeX support**.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Incremental reformulation of cards.
        - Parent-note edits propagate to child closes for efficient batch editing.

---

## Rewriting and Symbol Creation

## repetition in math   

there are two area  in mathematic  
main idea base on a recursive  list out the main idea of a  theorem this practice is too proof an equation and see if the equation make sense  , and if other equation can be used to proof another equation or theorem 
### proof  
is the foundation of mathematic read the proof  section in the obsidian  vault for future clarification  
to repetition a proof in mathematic  I should 
1. repetition by providing the name of proof then let the user of the proof solve it themself  
2. repetition by  filling in the gap the proof equation 
3. repetition by specify using what formula for the proof it self  
4. the proof  should be separated   into different section of  a courses . For  an example ,  Algebra should there is Preliminaries 
### practice  
is the part for solving an equation  practice is the used of the proof to solve an equation 
1. repetition practice I should give equation to solve 
	1. each equation belong to a specific section like this section is  about  Preliminaries 
	2. then for a single day there will be 2 question from a section  in the Anki test like for today Anki  will give me 40 equation I will need to solve them  and  there is 5 Preliminaries equation in that 
	3. there should be separation of test too if needed like for example  40 equation for the first test the second test will also be 40 equation but I know which test  I am currently doing
