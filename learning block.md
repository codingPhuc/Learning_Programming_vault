[[data structure and algorithm]] 
[[C++]]
math


for each courses there  will be an 3-5 hour block,  
## learning C++  

### Why I need to learn it 
I need to learn it because : 
1. I need to be able to program algorithm  efficiently in C++
2. I want to make VR game in unreal engine 
3. I want to program edge computing giving me an edge in AI  , also most AI run on C++ optimize setting  
### what I need to learn  

### How I am going to learn it 
I am going to learn it bases on my [[learning algebra road maps]] detailing thing like amount of time needed to learn, technique to learn the subject and how should I schedule my learning  



using the  10  percentage rule to know the amount of time 
### amount  of time 
The time it takes to learn C++ varies significantly depending on the individual's background, experience, and the depth of knowledge they aim to achieve. Here's a summary of the insights provided by various users:

1. **Basic Proficiency**:
    
    - **3 months**: To start making non-trivial programs.
        
    - **6 months**: To become comfortable with the toolchain and common compile errors.
        
    - **1.5 years**: To reliably tackle memory errors.
        
    - **3 years**: To understand and create templated classes and architect useful interfaces.
        
    - **5 years**: To feel competent in optimizing, debugging, and concurrency.
        
2. **Advanced Proficiency**:
    
    - **10 years**: To consistently offer good advice and spot problems in others' code.
        
    - **20+ years**: Still learning new things, though less frequently.
        
3. **General Consensus**:
    
    - Many users with decades of experience (25-30 years) still feel they are learning.
        
    - The language's complexity and continuous evolution mean that learning never truly ends.
        
4. **Initial Learning Curve**:
    
    - **3-4 months**: To get a good grip on the basics.
        
    - **2 years**: To begin understanding what's going on under the hood.
        
5. **Continuous Learning**:
    
    - The language is vast, and even basic concepts like iostream are deep.
        
    - New features and standards (e.g., std::print) continue to add to the learning curve.
        

In summary, while basic proficiency can be achieved in a few months to a couple of years, mastering C++ is a long-term endeavor that can span decades, especially given the language's depth and ongoing evolution. 


so bases on  this if I give  3 hour a day I will  become able to used the  basic in 4 month 
## Math [ALGEBRA](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/Alg/Alg.aspx)
### Why I need to learn it 
I need to have the basic understanding of  algebra in order to learn high level mathematic like  linear algebra 
### what I need to learn  
I need to learn all the subject outline in the link these subject include major area like [Preliminaries](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/Alg/Preliminaries.aspx) [Solving Equations and Inequalities](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/Alg/Solving.aspx) and ect. Future More ,  their sub subject suck as [Solving Equations and Inequalities](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/Alg/Solving.aspx) , [Integer Exponents](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/Alg/IntegerExponents.aspx)  , these learn  block are outline in Paul Online Notes . Paul Online note is an online resource that provide exercise , note and  assignment problem so that I can improve my algebra ability 
### How I am going to learn it 
I am going to learn it bases on my [[learning algebra road maps]] detailing thing like amount of time needed to learn, technique to learn the subject and how should I schedule my learning
