**Service orchestration** is like running all the tasks needed to design, build, and deliver a service from start to finish.

In the past, each part of this process was handled by separate, isolated systems that didn’t talk to each other, and these systems were built for networks that didn’t change much.

Now, with **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)** and **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**, things have changed.

- **NFV** lets network operators replace hardware devices (like routers and firewalls) with software that runs on standard computers. This makes networks cheaper, faster, and easier to upgrade.
- **SDN** gives operators more control by allowing them to manage networks through software, making them more flexible and easier to adjust.
