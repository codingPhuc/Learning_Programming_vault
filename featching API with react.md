# how to connect the react app to such a database 

you don't  ,  you don't  you will run into security issue  
writing code that run in   browser all the react will run in the browser all the visitor can run and  use that code  
user can retrieve that to insert or destroy data 
## front end code 
 cannot easy access a file system  
 live on some centra server or computer 
 don't have that in the browser 

# back end 
like a middle man  
can reach out on the backend  a computer  that run on your comp  
that backend code is  not accessoable to  the user only you 
used https request for inside the application to request the data or the change in the data 
with react you are writing client side code on the browser that can comminicate with your visotor 
the code in the databases is not accessible to your user  the backend is only for you  not the user  
common to have seperate front end and backend project 
backend can be used to build any language 
can also build fullstack react  app   blend backend and   front end
