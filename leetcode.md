To start improving your coding skills for interviews, follow this structured approach:

1. **Learn Patterns**: Begin by studying common coding patterns, as taught in courses like [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview). Focus on understanding how different algorithms and data structures work for specific types of problems, like sliding windows, binary search, and dynamic programming.
    
2. **Practice**: Use resources like the [Leetcode Patterns list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) to find practice problems categorized by these patterns. Solve as many problems as possible for each pattern.
    
3. **Analyze Solutions**: After solving each problem (or if you're stuck), review different solutions and compare them to your own. This will help you identify more efficient approaches and develop a deeper understanding of time and space complexity.
    
4. **Vary Your Practice**: After you've mastered solving problems within a pattern, try solving random Leetcode problems to practice identifying which pattern to use.
    
5. **Track Your Progress**: Keep a personal log of problems solved, the topics they covered, and notes on key takeaways. This will be helpful for reviewing concepts and sharpening your problem-solving skills.
    
6. **Consistency and Patience**: Understand that improvement comes with consistent practice. Don’t rush through problems—take the time to understand the constraints and complexities thoroughly.

# Two Integer Sum

Easy

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target` and `i != j`.

You may assume that _every_ input has exactly one pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition.  

problem that may hapend  : 
1. the array  can be very large 
2. the num[i] and the num[j] can be number in different position but I need to choose the one with the smallest index 
3. num
