# What are some good books that teach you about 'Art of Asking Questions'?

Recently I notice that "asking questions" itself is a very important skill. If you ask the right question, you can extract any knowledge from any person. Is there any book that talk about this topic?

Crucial Conversations by Kerry Patterson I found is a good one to think through how people approach situations and how to ask open ended empathetic questions.
Humble Inquiry by Ed Schein.
