# Prompt for writing 

I am looking for an IELTS English writing teacher to evaluate my writing and identify recurring mistakes (bottlenecks). I will provide two sections:

1. A model answer (correct and high-scoring).
2. My attempt at answering the same question.

Your task is to:

1. Compare my attempt with the model answer.
2. Highlight recurring mistakes in grammar, vocabulary, coherence, cohesion, and task response.
3. Provide detailed feedback on each sentence, including specific corrections and explanations.
4. Highlight the areas I need to learn or understand better to improve my writing.
5. Offer actionable suggestions and strategies for improvement to help me achieve a band 7.0 or higher.

Be thorough, formal, and detailed in your analysis, focusing equally on grammar, vocabulary, and overall writing quality. Additionally, emphasize key skills or concepts I should focus on mastering.


## Prompt for IETLS speaking 
I want to practice IELTS speaking with an instructor. I will provide a format for the speaking test (similar to the example provided, which includes Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3). Based on the format I paste, please act as my instructor, ask questions accordingly, and simulate a realistic IELTS speaking test. After I complete all three parts, provide comprehensive feedback focusing on fluency, coherence, vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and tone. Include specific examples of improved answers, highlight key areas for improvement, and offer actionable suggestions to address them. Additionally, provide tips for managing time, structuring answers effectively, and improving grammar accuracy.

The format will follow this structure:

- **Part 1:** Questions about personal topics, work, studies, or other familiar areas.
- **Part 2:** A longer topic where I describe a specific scenario or experience.
- **Part 3:** A discussion on broader topics related to Part 2 with multiple related questions.

Please ensure that feedback after all three parts includes clear, practical advice, key vocabulary improvements, and grammar corrections.
# Prompt to create  Prompt 
Welcome to the prompt engineering process. Your goal as a prompt engineer is to help me craft the best possible prompt that aligns with my needs. This prompt will be used by ChatGPT. Here's how the process will work:

First Response: Your initial response will ask me about the topic or subject of the prompt. I will provide my answer, but we will improve it through continuous iterations by following the next steps.

Revised Prompt and Questions: Based on my input, you will generate two sections: a) Revised Prompt: You will provide a rewritten prompt that is clear, concise, and easily understood by ChatGPT. This prompt will incorporate the information provided and any subsequent iterations. b) Questions: You will ask relevant questions to gather additional information needed from me to improve the prompt further.

Iterative Process: We will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section. We will repeat this cycle until I confirm that we have reached the desired prompt.

Let's start by clarifying the topic or subject of the prompt. Please provide your answer, and we will proceed with the iterative process to refine and enhance it until we achieve the best possible outcome.
