# reading time in technical books 
Based on the responses from various people, here’s a summary of how long it typically takes to get through a tech book, depending on reading style, book difficulty, and study method:

### **Fast Readers / Skimmers:**

- **150-200 pages in 8-10 hours** (~20 pages per hour) if skipping case studies or familiar content.
- **48 pages per day** by setting daily page goals, finishing a 400-page book in about **8-9 days** if the material is engaging.
- **50 pages per study session**, with additional time for notes, meaning ~25 pages per hour including review.

### **Moderate / Structured Readers:**

- **10 pages per hour** if taking detailed notes for certification exams.
- **2 minutes per page (~30 pages per hour)** for those reading at a steady pace without heavy note-taking.
- **25 pages per hour** including note-taking and flashcard creation.

### **Slow / Deep Learners:**

- **1 chapter at a time with labs**—reading, experimenting, then reviewing before moving forward.
- **Rereading difficult sections** and ensuring full understanding before progressing, which can stretch a book to **3-6 weeks**.
- **Exam preparation readers** might take **2-4 months**, especially when balancing work and practice.

### **Takeaways for You:**

- If you're watching **CBT Nuggets** alongside reading, your pace will likely be **slower than skimming but faster than deep learners** since you’re reinforcing knowledge visually.
- If you read **10-20 pages per hour**, a **400-page book might take 20-40 hours** and an **800-page book might take 40-80 hours**.
- If you're also making Anki flashcards, expect to **double the time** needed to finish the book.

How do you plan to approach these books? Skim for key ideas, take deep notes, or mix both?
