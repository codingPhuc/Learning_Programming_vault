## what  : 
- I need to be able to reflect upon myself  for effective studying to know the material  in a quick time slot   
- this can be a courses work , or a skill that need to be learn and understand deeply 
## why : 
- I need to do this  to improve on my own ability as a learner  plus learn skill that will help me greatly on the long run 
## how : 
- I will build an action plan that will enable  my reflection ability to the fullest  
- this plan will be different for each skill and each courses  
- I will be experimenting with each plan to see which  action to take out and which  action I will not 
##  basic method for reflection  
1. make the lesson  not boring  by  being curious or having a goal about how the lesson can help you in real  world scenario   
2. order of reflection should be :
	1. read  
	2. recite outload 
	3. write note  
	4. speech teach other about the lesson 
	5. then analyze the lesson clearly 
3. organize the note bases on  [[4 layer of learning#**Layer 1 The Logic Layer**]] organize it into different group and understand the bigger picture  
4. Review notes soon after lectures to make sure they make sense. Frequent review will decrease the amount of material you will need to relearn for exams.
5. used image technique to make sure you remember the material this mean transforming  text bases  to image bases recall , this can be archive by using Anki  recall image 
6. used  information  that have  been learn to learn new information that haven't ,   bases on the [[4 layer of learning#The Four-Layer Learning System for Better Understanding and Retention]] after you have master understand the initial map and how idea connect you will then learn how each 
7. short brush  then long brush  organize the material into short brush  if it is difficult then long brush  if it easier until you finally master the technique and can recite it anytime of day 
8. discuss the material  this can be archive by having a group of friend [[Learning technique#Really study with friend your all motivated to study together]]














# Emotion when studying 
Develop a positive attitude when you are studying. If you believe a subject is boring or unimportant, you will have more difficulty recalling the information. Develop a curiosity about the material.

# Top Ten Tips for Self-Testing


2. The order of study should be: read, recite aloud, write notes in your own words, ask yourself questions about the material, review. Memorization comes last after you have a solid understanding of the material.
3. Organize the material into meaningful clusters as this will help with recall.
4. Review notes soon after lectures to make sure they make sense. Frequent review will decrease the amount of material you will need to relearn for exams.
5. Expose as many senses as possible to the study material: write it, speak it, hear it, visualize it. This will help commit the material to memory.
6. Use imagery to remember material: Close your eyes and get a picture of the explanation and summary answer on the page. See the underlined key words.
7. Create associations with the material. It is easier to recall new information if it is attached to old, easily retrieved information.
8. Predict exam questions and actually write answers and work out problems. Over learning the materials helps to make sure you know it.
9. Recency-latency effect: Memorize materials in short intervals of time as you are more likely to remember the material at the start and at the end of your study intervals. Recite what you have memorized at random times.
10. Use study aides: note cards of key points, key words, definitions, and equations; go into greater depth, do extra problems, immerse yourself; explain the main ideas to friends, join a study group.

## Proof reading 
Correctness of proofs is based on our belief, that a higher conceptual level proof, can be reduced to a pure logical system, following logic deductions rules like _modus ponens_.

Practically, No one reduces her/his proofs up to that level of details. You should just be confident enough that your proof is devoid of logical flaws.

The best way is to read others' proofs, reproducing them on your own, and trying to figure any logical flaw. Also, interaction and feedback from colleagues and mentors is a necessity.

> is it really even possible to self study advanced mathematics if there is no one to check your work for the exercises?

Yes, It is possible if you have a good maturity. For beginners, You need to be really really precautioned from concluding you have a correct proof.

> should I throw my own ‘test cases’ at it similar to algorithmic coding problems and then believe I’m correct based on that?

Testing is for engineering-based endeavors. You are ought to take care of logic. Studying logic and mathematical logic might be insightful for you.

> Should my solution always exactly match those found online

I don't recommend reading solutions of problems, at all. The problem set are meant for you to solve them on your own. Always relying on others solutions will trap you in their perspectives, and shall hinder you from developing your own maturity.

> Should I just get a mentor or tutor to ‘grade’ my work instead?

Definitely being around a supportive community is a necessity. However, Don't stop self-studying; Just keep in mind your proofs might be flawed. I recommend you to start with _Real Analysis: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook_ by _Jay Cummings_.

##  reading and exercising on book 
Too trully know wether you know the material or not you have have to solve examples. Like say you are doing integrals. Get a nice book with solved exercises and test your self if you can do them without looking at the solutions. Once you have solved it without taking a peak in the solution page and you are absolutely 100% you solved it correctly check what the author did. There are sometimes many who use weird stuff in math so you should be really careful and be able to judge wether it is a good approach or not. If you have mastered the basic you have to advance to more hard stuff. It is like a lego you start building blocks until you reach your desired goal. This method will surely help you because you will self-test yourself. By doing this after a while you will begin to see something beautiful you will start thinking as the authors of the books you solve. If you notice that one day you have become a master at the specific topic




## tips 
## 1. “Do” practice daily

Just like athletes and musicians, students need daily practice. It’s better to study often for shorter amounts of time than it is to study occasionally for longer amounts. Consistency over time triggers your long-term memory, whereas long, infrequent study sessions engage short-term memory. 3Daily practice is like the manna that fed the Israelites in the wilderness: it will only nourish you one day at a time. Trying to cram all your studying into a single day will make most of it spoil. 4

Don't forget to ask for help from tutors and instructors!

## 2. “Don’t” just reread your textbook or notes

While it’s important to make sure you understand what’s being taught, practicing difficult problems will help you learn better than simply reading your textbook or notes. 5 Consider solving example problems from relevant past lessons — or you can create your own problems to test yourself!

## 3. “Do” spend time on hard problems

The harder a problem, the more you should do it. Try to determine what kinds of problems are the most difficult for you. Spend extra time reviewing these questions, and reach out to your classmates or instructor if you need extra help. 6

## 4. “Don’t” redo all of your homework

Doing all of your homework again to study will take too much time. Only redo the problems you struggle with. Work smarter not longer! 7

Use all the tools available to prepare.

## 5. “Do” use flash cards

We commonly think of using flash cards for learning a language or remembering historical dates, but flash cards can be useful for math too! 8

Instead of memorizing a specific answer, use flash cards to memorize the process of solving different types of math problems. Write down the steps you took and equations you used to solve each problem. This will help you understand how to solve multiple test questions, not just one.

## 6. “Don’t” casually look through your homework

As you look at past assignments, focus on specific concepts and problems instead of quickly rereading everything. Write down any questions you have so that you can review them during your study time or ask them later with a tutor.

## 7. Remember, you can “do” it!
