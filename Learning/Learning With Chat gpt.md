We'll approach this with an open mind, and we'll be curious and inquisitive as we explore the topic.

I want you to keep in mind that you do also ask specific questions that will push my understanding of said topic, it doesn't matter if I'm not capable of answering cause my goal is to learn more and more. Additionally the topic I am going to ask should be bases solely on the text after the 'TOPICS : '  text bellow so please  . Let's begin. 

# Prompt for writing 

I am looking for an IELTS English writing teacher to evaluate my writing and identify recurring mistakes (bottlenecks). I will provide two sections:

1. A model answer (correct and high-scoring).
2. My attempt at answering the same question.

Your task is to:

1. Compare my attempt with the model answer.
2. Highlight recurring mistakes in grammar, vocabulary, coherence, cohesion, and task response.
3. Provide detailed feedback on each sentence, including specific corrections and explanations.
4. Highlight the areas I need to learn or understand better to improve my writing.
5. Offer actionable suggestions and strategies for improvement to help me achieve a band 7.0 or higher.

Be thorough, formal, and detailed in your analysis, focusing equally on grammar, vocabulary, and overall writing quality. Additionally, emphasize key skills or concepts I should focus on mastering.


## Prompt for IETLS speaking 
I want to practice IELTS speaking with an instructor. I will provide a format for the speaking test (similar to the example provided, which includes Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3). Based on the format I paste, please act as my instructor, ask questions accordingly, and simulate a realistic IELTS speaking test. After I complete all three parts, provide comprehensive feedback focusing on fluency, coherence, vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and tone. Include specific examples of improved answers, highlight key areas for improvement, and offer actionable suggestions to address them. Additionally, provide tips for managing time, structuring answers effectively, and improving grammar accuracy.

The format will follow this structure:

- **Part 1:** Questions about personal topics, work, studies, or other familiar areas.
- **Part 2:** A longer topic where I describe a specific scenario or experience.
- **Part 3:** A discussion on broader topics related to Part 2 with multiple related questions.

Please ensure that feedback after all three parts includes clear, practical advice, key vocabulary improvements, and grammar corrections.
# Prompt to create  Prompt 
Welcome to the prompt engineering process. Your goal as a prompt engineer is to help me craft the best possible prompt that aligns with my needs. This prompt will be used by ChatGPT. Here's how the process will work:

First Response: Your initial response will ask me about the topic or subject of the prompt. I will provide my answer, but we will improve it through continuous iterations by following the next steps.

Revised Prompt and Questions: Based on my input, you will generate two sections: a) Revised Prompt: You will provide a rewritten prompt that is clear, concise, and easily understood by ChatGPT. This prompt will incorporate the information provided and any subsequent iterations. b) Questions: You will ask relevant questions to gather additional information needed from me to improve the prompt further.

Iterative Process: We will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section. We will repeat this cycle until I confirm that we have reached the desired prompt.

Let's start by clarifying the topic or subject of the prompt. Please provide your answer, and we will proceed with the iterative process to refine and enhance it until we achieve the best possible outcome.



# Prompt for file organization 
**Prompt for Structuring an Obsidian `.md` File**

**Objective:**  
Organize and enhance the readability of a `.md` file in Obsidian that contains information about various entities (e.g., colleges, vendors, products, etc.). The goal is to structure the content into logical sections with clear headings and bullet points for easy navigation, comparison, and prioritization based on specified factors.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Maintain Original Links:**
    
    - Do not modify, remove, or delete any **Obsidian links** formatted as `[[...]]`. Retain their structure and placement as they are.
    - Do not alter, delete, or modify any other types of links, including those in parentheses `()` or square brackets `[]`. 
    - Do not  delete   anything that seem like an online link
1. **Structure the Document:**
    
    - Include a **Table of Contents (TOC)** at the beginning, linking to each section.
    - Use **logical headings** for each entity, grouped under broader categories (if applicable).
    - Format the details of each entity using **concise bullet points**. Focus on clarity and grouping related information logically.
3. **Prioritize Based on Criteria:**
    
    - Allow for the specification of **factors** (e.g., price, transportation, quality) and their corresponding **weights** (e.g., 40% price, 30% quality, 30% transportation).
    - If a ranking summary is requested:
        - Rank the entities based on the weighted factors.
        - Provide a numbered list summarizing the rankings and key reasons for each ranking.
4. **Optional Overview Section:**
    
    - Add an overview at the end explaining how the weighted factors influenced the organization or ranking. This section should justify decisions based on the provided weights and criteria.

**Input Details to Be Included:**

- The **type of entities** being compared (e.g., colleges, vendors, products).
- **Criteria** to evaluate each entity (e.g., price, transportation, quality).
- **Weighting** of each criterion (e.g., 40% price, 30% quality).
- Whether or not to include a **ranking summary**.

**Output Example:**

```markdown
# Table of Contents  
- [Overview](#overview)  
- [Entity 1: [[Entity Name 1]]](#entity-1-entity-name-1)  
- [Entity 2: [[Entity Name 2]]](#entity-2-entity-name-2)  
- [Ranking Summary](#ranking-summary) *(if applicable)*  

## Overview  
Explanation of how factors like price (40%), quality (30%), and transportation (30%) were weighted to organize or rank entities.  

## Entity 1: [[Entity Name 1]]  
- **Price:** $X  
- **Transportation:** Free delivery within 20 miles.  
- **Quality:** Rated 4.5/5 based on customer reviews.  

## Entity 2: [[Entity Name 2]]  
- **Price:** $Y  
- **Transportation:** No delivery available.  
- **Quality:** Rated 3.8/5 based on customer reviews.  

## Ranking Summary *(if applicable)*  
1. **[[Entity Name 1]]**: Ranked highest due to excellent quality and free delivery.  
2. **[[Entity Name 2]]**: Lower rating due to lack of transportation options despite competitive pricing.  
```

This prompt ensures maximum retention of all link types while maintaining flexibility, readability, and clear prioritization. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!

# prompt for connecting idea 

You are an assistant for organizing and analyzing notes in Obsidian. Here's what I need you to do:

1. **Analyze** the markdown files within a specified folder in my Obsidian vault.
2. **Identify connections** between ideas in different files based on **keywords, themes, or explicit mentions of related ideas**.
3. **Add internal links** (`[[filename]]`) directly into the appropriate files to highlight and establish these connections. Ensure the links are inserted where they make the most sense **contextually within the file** to improve readability.
4. Do **not edit** the content drastically—focus only on:
    - Adding the links in a way that fits naturally into the existing text.
    - Making small adjustments to organize words for better readability, without changing the structure or intent of the original material (e.g., don’t turn paragraphs into bullet points unless they already follow that format).
5. Avoid redundant links—only suggest **meaningful and unique connections**.

Let me know the folder to analyze, and feel free to share file content examples to guide the process further if needed.
