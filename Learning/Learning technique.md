# Different Types of Learning
## Learning by Cooperation
## Learning by Reading

### Why You Read a Book
You want to be able to learn something from it to extract the thought and idea into your brain and transform it into knowledge. See [[book learning/How to read a book and Actually learn from it|detailed reading guide]].

### How You Read a Book
Let’s say that you have a picture of a fish. You need to be able to go deeper and deeper into the picture to see its details and shape. You need to see the complexity. [[book learning/How To Get The Most Out of A Book - Analytical Reading|Learn more about analytical reading]].

## Deep Learning Through Repetition
So just like with a picture, you need to drive deeper and deeper into a book's knowledge. This can be achieved by reading the book again and again.
- Learning is like going to the gym; you start with small weights then increase the intensity.
- Initially, you do not need to understand the book; you just need to read it. By continually reading, you will get the main idea.
- Start small: 1 page a day, 7 pages a week, etc. Just think, if you have a book with 500 pages, you will finish it in about 500 days or more if you continue the intensity.
- Remember, "you cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only do so backward."
- Use [[Self Testing|spaced repetition]] to reinforce learning.

## Reflection and Implementation
You need to relate the book's content to your own life. Let’s say that you have a problem with how to structure your learning; you apply the principles of the book to boost your learning efficiency and make the book your own. [[book learning/How to read technical books|See technical reading tips]].

You need to read with reflection. Reading without reflection is like eating without digesting.
- Prioritize the changes that have the most impact. This can be a chapter that you can apply to your work the most.
- Remember to summarize the book. By summarizing, you get to understand the book better.
- Remember to keep an analog of the book's understanding in your second brain.

## Action Plans
You should use signposting to get the overall structure of a chapter. That means having the big idea to connect to so you can group them if needed. For example, if the chapter read by signposting has 3 main ideas, then when you skim read, you will be able to group each section to the idea. See [[thing you need to do|action items]].
For example, in a chapter, signposting can include:
- **Headings and subheadings** to indicate different sections.
- **Topic sentences** that introduce the main idea of each paragraph.
- **Transitional phrases** like _"firstly," "in contrast," "as a result,"_ to show connections between ideas.
- **Summaries and conclusions** that reinforce key takeaways.

You need an action plan: ready, aim, and fire.
- The reason why many people do not have a six-pack is due to them not taking action. Take action and have a six-pack.
- The results you will achieve will only remain over time.
- You need to be patient and not give up.
- Adjust when the action cannot be completed.

## Learning Process
![[learning structure#Bloom’s Taxonomy]]
1. Introduction - you are introduced to the subject, and if you have enough enthusiasm, you can keep learning more.
2. Information processing: learn new information and make it a part of your knowledge.
3. Repetition - repeated learning and practice the subject. See [[How I Ranked 1st at Cambridge University - 20 Study Tips|effective study methods]].
4. Analyze the information to the new topic to avoid false negatives.
5. Accept or reject: decide if you want to learn more about the information.
6. Growth - continue to learn about the subject in different topics.

- Active Recall
- Interleaving
- Take strategic breaks

# Consistency When Learning

# Feynman Learning Technique

# Note Taking is a Waste of Time

# Ignoring How You Feel

# Do One Thing at a Time

## Interleaving
Interleaving is the process of converting a study subject into blocks, then studying one block after another. The trick is to switch up the subject blocks based on the time or based on the completion.

# Improve Your Life Habit
## Study with Friends
Studying with friends is another benefit. It will improve your mood, create memorable memories, and improve your study output. Understand that friends are there to help you improve, not to solve the problem for you, so it is in your best interest to say "test me on this" instead of "solve this for me".

## Diet and Exercise
You should really plan out exercise as well. Studies have shown that if you create an exercise block while studying, you will be able to learn effectively.
Have a healthy habit; a healthy body is better when studying.

# Take Breaks When Needed
If you push your body too much, the body will break on you. So you need to be eating healthy, sleep when your body needs it. The suggestion is to put a sleep block in the afternoon or sleep when your body needs you to.

# Active Recall
- We need to test ourselves.
- Put it into our brain.
- You need to retrieve information in our brain.
- Book - make it stick.
- Not testing yourself enough leads to improvement of your score.
- The forgetting curve: when you learn something for the first time, you will forget it, and the curve goes down.
- Consistency that you do will make the curve never go away.

## Do More Mock Exams
- You should study to get knowledge, not to get exams.
- You should add in a fair to your exam. Look as a person that has a high mark.
- Make your easy more partly.

## Do One Thing at a Time
Share focus mode in devices.
- The phone should be turned off all notifications.
- When you are out doing manual work, you should focus on those distractions.

## Take Breaks When Needed
- Live pomodoro timer.

- Learning by cooperation
- Learning by reading

### Reading Strategies
You want to extract thoughts and ideas to transform them into knowledge. Think of it like examining a picture of a fish - you need to go deeper to see details and complexity.

### Deep Learning Through Repetition
- Learning is like going to the gym - start small and increase intensity.
- Start with 1 page a day, 7 pages a week.
- Connect with [[Why You Are Always Distracted]].

### Reflection and Implementation
- Relate book concepts to your life.
- Reading without reflection is like eating without digesting.
- Use [[Self Testing]] for review.

### Action Plans
7. Use signposting for chapter structure.
8. Ready, aim, fire approach:
   - Take action ([[Thing You Need To Do]]).
   - Be patient.
   - Adjust when needed.

### Learning Process
9. Introduction.
10. Analysis.
11. Acceptance/Rejection.
12. Information Processing.
13. [[How to be Productive]].
14. Growth.
