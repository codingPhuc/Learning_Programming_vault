# different type of learning 
## learning by cooperation 
## learning by  reading 

### why you read a book  
you want to be able to learn something from it to extract the thought and idea into your brain and transform it into knowledge. See [[book learning/How to read a book and Actually learn from it|detailed reading guide]].

### how you read a book 
let say that you have a picture of a fish you need to be able to go deeper and deeper into the picture to see it detail and shape you need to see the complexity. [[book learning/How To Get The Most Out of A Book - Analytical Reading|Learn more about analytical reading]].

## repetition for deep drive  
so just like with a picture you need to drive deeper and deeper into a book knowledge this can be archive by reading the book again and again   
- learning is like going to the gym, you start with the small weight then up the intensity 
- initially you do not need to understand the books you just need to read it by continually reading you will get the main idea  
- start small 1 page a day 7 page a week ect, just thing you have book with 500 page you will finish it in like 500 day or more if you continue the intensity 
- remember "you cannot connect the dot looking forward you can only do so backward" 
- Use [[Self Testing|spaced repetition]] to reinforce learning

## reflection 
you need to relate the book condition to your own life let say that you have problem with how to structure your learning you apply the principle of the book to boost your learning efficiency and make the book your own. [[book learning/How to read technical books|See technical reading tips]].

you need to eat with reflection thing reading without reflection like eating without digesting 
prioritize the change that are the most impact this can be a chapter that you can apply to your work the most  
remember to summarize the book by summarizing you get to understand the book better 
remember to keep an analog of the book understanding in your second brain  

## action plans 
you should used sign posting to get the overall structure of a chapter that mean that having the big idea to connect to so you can group them if needed, for example if the chapter read by sign posting have 3 main idea then when you skim read you will be able to group each section to the idea. See [[thing you need to do|action items]].

you need an action plan ready aim and fire 
	- the reason why many people do not have a six pact is due to them not taking action take action and have a six pact 
	- the result you will be archive will only now remain on time 
	- you need to be patient and not give up 
	- adjustment when the action cannot be completed  

### making the book your own  
the book need scar of war or scar of learning in order to be made your own so, so highlight the important detail of the book add in sticky note and what not. [[Asking question|Ask critical questions]] while reading.
the idea is to like have a conversation with the author of the books on his theory and subject

### learning the process 
1. introduction - you are introduce to the subject and if you have enough enthusiasm you can keep learning more 
2. analyze the information to the new topic to avoid false negative 
3. accept or reject: decide if you want to learn more about the information 
4. information processing: learn new information and make it a part of your knowledge 
5. repetition - repeated learning. See [[How I Ranked 1st at Cambridge University - 20 Study Tips|effective study methods]]
6. growth continue to learn about the subject in different topic 
7. 

## learning by video  
# tree diagram  
# Having a plan for learning 
If you do not have a plan and a clear small goal in mind your mind will wander off to look at social media thus making all your effort in vain 
Suggestion on how to make a plan : 
- create a calendar plan out each weeks of your life to see what you need  to do 
- look at the recommended hour for a courses or hour to learn a technology 
- plan out exactly like those hour suggest for your week  and on etc  
example : 
think of learning react 
- what is the fundamental structure of react 
- what problem does react solve 
- how can you apply the problem with exercise 
- if you encounter the problem in the exercise remember to revisit the previous step  
remember the ![[learning structure#Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy]]

## consistency when learning 



# Feynman  learning technique
#  note taking is a waste of time 
# Ignoring how you feel

# do one thing at a time 

## interleaving  
interleaving is the process of converting a study subject into blocks then studying won block after another  . The chick is to switch up the subject blocks bases on the time or bases on the completion 

#  Improve your life habit 
## Really study with friend  your all motivated to study together 
studying with friend is another benefit it will improve your mood create memorable memory  , improve your study output . Understand that friend are their to help you improve not to solve the problem for you so it is in your best interest to say "test me on this" instead of "solve this for me"
## diet and exercise 
you should really plan out exercise as well , study have shown that if you create a exercise block while studying you will be able to learn effectively ? 
have a healthy habit a healthy body is better when studying 
# take break when you needed it  
if you push your body to much the body will break on you , so you need to be eating healthy , sleep when your body need it the suggestion is to put a sleep block in the after noon or sleep when your body need you too 
# Active Recall 
- we need to test our self  
- put it into our brain  
- you need to retrieve information in our brain  
book - make it stick  
you not testing your self enough lead to improvement of your score
- the forgeting curve  when you learn something from the first time you you will forgeted and the curve go down 
- consistency that you do will make the curve never going aways 

## do more mock exam 
- you  should study to get knowledge not to get exam  
- you should add in a fair to your exam  look as a person that have a high mark  
- make your easy more pearty 

## do one thing at a time 
share focus mode in devices 
-  the phone should  be turn off all notification  
- when you are out doing manual work you should focus on those distraction   
## take break when you needed it 
- live pomodoro timer

### Reading Strategies
You want to extract thoughts and ideas to transform them into knowledge. Think of it like examining a picture of a fish - you need to go deeper to see details and complexity.

### Deep Learning Through Repetition
- Learning is like going to the gym - start small and increase intensity
- Start with 1 page a day, 7 pages a week
- Connect with [[Why You Are Always Distracted]]

### Reflection and Implementation
- Relate book concepts to your life
- Reading without reflection is like eating without digesting
- Use [[Self Testing]] for review

### Action Plans
1. Use signposting for chapter structure
2. Ready, aim, fire approach:
   - Take action ([[Thing You Need To Do]])
   - Be patient
   - Adjust when needed

### Learning Process
1. Introduction
2. Analysis
3. Acceptance/Rejection
4. Information Processing
5. [[How to be Productive]]
