## **Chapter I: Can You Get an MIT Education Without Going to MIT?**

Summary: 
	The chapter talk about Scott Young and other ultra learner  to become a ultra learner and his journey on Why What and How he completed the  MIT Challenge. Moreover , the benefit he have with his ultra learning experience  like he noted  instead of  " doing each assignment and waiting weeks to learn my results" he could "material one question at a time, quickly learning from my mistakes" and also reduce the cost of his tuition . The chapter also talk about his encounter with other ultra learner the achievement    that hey have made in their ultra learning journey in order to descript these people having one simple   characteristics   that being their ultra learning ability , the  writer also want to combine their method into a single guild to make anyone be able to be a ultra learner 
	Main Ideas: The main Ideal is to let the reader know the achievement of the ultra learner so that they can feel inspire by the ultra learner experience and how hey can achieve the same result 
Examples & Case Studies: 
	example include ultra learner "Benny Lewis" who could learn and speak the language in three month time,  his approach was to start speaking on the very first day  even thought he fail to get  C2 in 3 month because of applying incorrect method for learning the listening test,   it is still and impressive feet in the 3 month timelines  
	"Roger  Craig" the champion of  Jeopardy a game that have randomize question, due to his obsessive love of the game. Moreover, his studying technique using space repetition  software algorithm for both correcting mistake and prioritizing the most frequently tested topics on Jeopardy
	"Eric Barone " wanting to create  his own video game similar to that of harvest moon , he compare him self to other asking if Why they did something How they did it and what can he apply to his own game , to reduce the time being wasted he work  as  a crasher at a local cinema earn minimum wage

Personal Takeaways:
	From the thing I have read about each ultra learning Journey have made me understand that ultra learning is a repeatable process that can be broken down into principle  enabling it user the ability learn subject as a fast rate  with enough time  , dedication and strategy  . The first chapter is a roadmap, introducing key individual and their method to prepare the reader for a deeper drive the nine principle of ultra learning in the coming chapters
Actionable Steps:
	step of action : 
	I have known of 4 ultra learner now those being "Benny Lewis ", "Roger Craig" ,  "Eric Barone" and the author of the book "Scot Young" 
	I have now have a clear understanding of what an ultra learning person is , a person who is obsessive with learning skill in a short amount of time and will used different strategy to get the optimize result 
	I now have clear understanding of the bench mark I need to achieve to become an ultra learner

## **Chapter II: Why Ultralearning Matters**

- **Summary:** 
	- ultra learning is a strategy for acquiring skills and knowledges that is both self directed  and intense 
	- Strategy in ultra learning is a choice not a command , ultra learning is self directed  
	- self directed mean that being in the driver sheet of a project not in the back sheet 
	- all ultra learner took  step to maximize there learning output 
	- realize that ultra learning will make you full file because your moment of  happiness does not come from easy pleasure but it come from overcoming an obstacles 
	- In Today world with AI  development and skill like software engineer require a constance stream of knowledge  , it make being  mediocre a danger  
	- Collage instead of being a free education for all have turn into a money grap which each passing year  causing those who blindly follow courses to suffer not  only financially but also academic inefficiency , for the former  it due to the rising cost of tuition and for the latter it that school does not teach skill that translate well into practice for high paying job 
	- technology have been continuously changing and affect both our vice and virtues making us more distracted but also providing us with more accessible information  some of these are : 
		 - Free courses from Harvard , MIT , and Yale  
		 - Space-repetition software (like Anki) to improve memory  retention 
		 - Language learning apps , podcasts , and AI tools that help people learn faster 
	- rescuing your career  ultra learning project will help you with accelerating your career and help you in economic down turn  when one specific skill will not be enough to combat the changing world the author then list out example like "Colby Durant" and "Vishal Maini" one learn copy writing in record speed for a promotion , other yearn for passion decide to ultra learn to switch career 
	- three way to pursue ultra learning when you do not have the time 
		- ultra learning  part time - setting aside hours in your schedule for structure learning 
		- Learning during break or transition - Using unemployment , summer breaks , or sabbaticals 
		- Optimize exiting learning time - Making traditional study method  more efficient by applying ultra learning 
 - **Key Arguments:** 
	- **Work & Career Growth** – Ultralearning can accelerate promotions, help career transitions, and provide a competitive edge.
	- **Personal Fulfillment** – Learning difficult things creates a deeper sense of achievement and purpose.
	- **Adapting to a Changing World** – With technology evolving rapidly, the ability to **learn quickly** is becoming more important than ever.
	 - you can make time in ultra learning in 3 different way   
- **Real-World Applications:** 
	- "Colby Durant" and "Vishal Maini"  both have used ultra learning to improve on their skill sheet with the former being able to recue and advance her job, and the latter the ability to switch jobs when his skill reach the desire position 
- **Important Quotes:**
	- “Designed in California. Made in China.” this quotes on apple IPhone signify the importance of today changing time for ultra learning 
- **How This Applies to You:**
I know now that ultra learning can help with both advancing my career and my ability to learn, in today changing world there is a need for ultra leaner people who learn skill at an extremely fast rate, creating opportunity more them. I can take my time with ultra learning in 3 way if I am busy that being part time ultra learning , gap ultra learning and same direction ultra learning

## **Chapter III: How to Become an Ultralearner**
- summary  :  The chapter start off with de Montebello who was a musical before becoming an ultra learner. He choose his ultra learning subject in public speaking because he thing that   “Public speaking is a metaskill” that assists with other skill like   “confidence, storytelling, writing, creativity, interviewing skills, selling skills. It touches on so many different things." . To succeed in his endeavor  he enroll in meeting of Toastmasters International , organization for learning public speaking, with this he reach two lucky break : 
	- being able to completed in a World Championship of Public Speaking 
	- Meting MiChael  Gendler  
The competition was importance because it provided a potential structure for  his ultra learning project , giving him a six mandatory qualifying speech to meet  his criterial . When seeking advice Gendler just said to seek something  scariest for him and trust what ever get in his head. Some friend gave him tips on stage present to used his body with his word to communicate, Gendler told him to make him care  
de Montebello have told him the depth of his skill and how it landed him a client of his choosing over 20000$ , due to his obsessive work ethic he manage to  reach his goal . As a result , de Montebello became a guild to other ultra learner that those who are obsessive about their goal will win in the end  and acquired their desire skill sheet 
De Montebello story illustrated that ultra learning is  not a cookie-cutter method , but the uniqueness of ultra learning project is what glue it all together . As  a result, we need principle to outline our ultra learning  like in physic principle help with simplifying problem by working backward. The principle is only a guild not an order so you need to used your only creativity to learn used and build it each embodies a particular aspect of successful learning 


- **Core Learning Strategies:**
Meta  Learning  :   Start by  drawing a map to learn new skill , do good research  and draw on your past competencies to optimize your learning
Focus : Sharpen your Knife. Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunk of time  when you can to focus on learning 
Directness : go straight ahead , learn by doing thing you want to be good at . Do not do task that are easy 
Drill : attack your week point  , split your learning into smaller part then  drill to master part the part that you are  struggle with 
Retrieval : Test to learn testing is a way of creating knowledge, test your self before you even feel confident in the knowledge  
Feedback : Don't Dodge the punch . Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable , do not let your ego get in the way . Extract insight in the noisy data 
Retention : do not fill  a leaky bucket, understand what you forget and why 
Intuition : dig deep before building up. Develop your intuition through play and exploration , don't recourse to cheap trick of memorization 
Experimentation : Explore outside your comfort zone  no just from following path by other but from exploring possibilities 
- **Steps to Implement Ultralearning:**
1. pick a skill with high  impact (career , personal growth) 
2. Research & create a learning roadmap (study how experts learned it) 
3. Focus deeply (remove distractions , not just studying) 
4. Apply directness (learn by doing ,  not just studying) 
5. Reinforce with retrieval && retention (active recall & spaced repetition) 
6. Experiment (customize learning strategies for better result) 


- **Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Reflection Questions:** 
	- How can I create a roadmap for learning my next skill ? 
	- How will I integrate "direct practice" into my learning ? 
	- What strategies will I use to maintain focus and avoid distractions ? 
	- How will I test myself regularly to reinforce learning

## **Chapter [IV]: Principle  Principle 1 Metalearning First Draw a Map

## **Definition of the Principle:** 
determining the why what and how of meta learning , "Why" refers to understanding your motivation to learn , "What" is the knowledge and ability you need to acquire to be successful  "How" refer to resources and method you need to used to become successful 
Answering the "Why" helps define  intrinsic  vs instrumental learning : 
there are different type of project Instrumental learning project , learning with purpose of archiving a different example Diana Fehsenfeld 
Intrinsic project those that you are learning for your own sack like you want to learn French to speak French for example  `
expert interview method :  
The expert interview method  is to talk to people who skill set you want to archive , look  for people who have the career you want and send an email , with the goal of building your application for example  online forms dedicated to programming 
useful to ask your self what you are trying to learn  
Answering "What " Vategorizes knowledge into Concepts , Facts , and Procedures :  
A good way to do this is too write down on a sheet of paper three columns "Concepts"  "Fact"  " Procedure" 
You can always revisited it later  , you can adjust the list if you discover your category is not quite right 
Concepts : 
idea that you need to understand in flexible ways in order for it to be used full . Some subject like allow have a hybrid of both concept and fact , that need to be understand and memorize in order to be used full. In general if something need to be understood not memorize put it in the first columns 
Facts  : 
Write down anything that needs to be memorized . Facts are anything that suffices if you can remember them  at all. You don't need to understand them just recall them in the right situation
Procedure : 
in the third columns write down anything that need to be practice may not involve much conscious thinking at all . even thought some  procedure require fact  , like improving pronunciation
Analysis to draw your Map  : 
this  will give you a good understanding of what your major bottle neck are going to be, and what resource  and methods that you need to search to overcome those difficulties 
like for example you need to learn fact quickly so you used space repetition software or the thing you need to learn require a deep understanding of concept so you practice by teaching other 
look at some of the particular feature of the concept , fact , and procedures you're trying to learn to find method to master them 
Answering "How" :  
How are you going to learn it 
bench mark  
common way in which people learn the skill or subject , for school learning look at the curricula  used in that school  to teach that subject for the MIT challenge the course list for an entire degree 
The Emphasize / Exclude  Method :  
Once you've found a default  curriculum , you can consider making modification to it . you can make a guess . As an example ,  for conceptual subjects or topics that you do not really understand than it is best to stick too your bench mark . The Emphasize and Exclude method involves first finding areas of study that align with the goals you identified  in the first part of your research , if you want to focus pronunciation I would go to France for speaking  , if you want to develop your own app focus on tutorial instead of theory of computation 

The  10 percent rule  : 
10 percent of your learning time into research prior to starting , if you spend  six month  learning that will be 100 hour  in research , this process will also scale up as you learn meaning the percentage will be lower bases on the larger amount of time .The goal here is not to latch on to a single possible resource 
Diminishing  Returns  and Marginal Benefit Calculation  : 
so Reassessing is a necessary step of the learning process . I discover about  halfway that I was getting diminishing return need a better technique for my drawing . So you not only research when starting a project but when you compare the marginal benefits of whether your learn is good enough , interview with more expert  searching online for more technique if the other technique was not too help full you are better off sticking with your original plan 
Long Term Prospect for Metalearning : 
the real benefit of meta learning is not short but long terms 
Better time management and improve skills for managing  your motivation . Ultimately , this effect far outweighs the effect of doing a specific project. Long terms meta learning is something you acquire with experience 





## Why It’s Important:
**Meta learning is learning how thing structure , like 灶 stove in Chinese  we know that it have properties  like  ⽕ on the left-hand side to indicate that it has some relationship to fire . As a result , this show the structure in  language , meta learning on the other hand show the structure of learning . Moreover , the structure here is what kind of skill and information much be mastered , and what method are available to do so more effectively  is a heart of success for ultra learning  


## **Key Examples:** 
Dan Everett  in his early sixties manage to learn and understand a language that does not have key information like the name or how to pronounce and speak  .  He manage to  accomplish  this feet by  listening too another person speaking the language and writing the verb noun and  pronouns on a chart broad  . Dan Everett have two thing in his linguistic arsenal how a language operate and method for fluency have enable  him to become fluent in Piraha  
"Diana Fehsenfeld" who  after a few decade of being a librarian found that her job have become obsolete and need to transit to a new flied  so she choose  statistics and data visualization 

- **Best Practices:**
- **How to Apply This Principle:**
The best way to apply these principle is to draw a map , first a table which 3 column fact , concepts and practice   
- I need to see if the subject I am trying  


## **Chapter [V]: Principle [2]—[Chapter V Principle 2 Focus Sharpen Your Knife]**

### **Definition of the Principle:**  
Falling to start focusing  ,  obvious way this manifest it self is when you  procrastinate   ,   procrastinate is the constant of their life running aways from their task to another until deadline  . I had no problem sitting and watchin MIT class but I do have a problem with tackling  the problem set with serious trepidation 
There is a lot of reason why we procrastinate , like for the author he procrastinate because he had a lot of idea on the writing of the books  . Most  procrastination is silly when you say them out loud  , but that doesn't stop it from ruling over your life  
you don't want to do thing you are suppose to do because  discomfort in doing it  or    you are more interested in doing other fun thing 
you avoid thing because it is uncomfortable , painful this awareness  is necessary for progress to be made  . As a result , in order to easily reconize your  tendency to  procrastinate  you much create mental crutches , these "crutches " help you thought some of the most challenging part of your work  , when you remove your tendency to procrastination these  "crutches " can be remove completely 
the first crutches come from recognizing the most uncomfortable part of your  task (if you are averse to it) , or what is present about an alternative task  (if you are attractive to it) 
get over just the few minute of maximal unpleasantness  before you take a break  , tell your self that you will  spend 5-10 minute on tasks will help you get started 
if you find that you take break too often then it best to employed a technique like the Pomorado  technique  so that you have a gradual approach to over comming procrastination .
You may want to used calendar to  crave out a specific chunks of time to for you  to learn . 
I you find your self setting up  a chunk of time and frequently ignoring it then it is best to rethink your schedule or adapt the pomodoro technique 


Problem 2 : Failing to sustain  focus  (aka getting distracted) 
you fail to maintain focus thought out  your study session due to external and internal factor 
Flow  , a  concept by  Mihály Csíkszentmihályi is often used as a model for describing what focus really is like  . This state is similar to being in the zone . You stop  being distracted and your mind become absorb by the task at hand . Flow by other scientist have discover a down side as well , it does not have feedback or errors detection . As a result , skill performer may enjoy seeking out flow  activity  , but this approach may not do well in ultra learning 
The author advice is that do not worry about the flow state there may be automatic problem or  study session where you will employed flow like solving math problem , these is some that don't like trying out new learning method  
After considering how you should focus , let now consider how long your focus should be . You should not cram hour of focus on to one session there should be interleaving break in between . There should also be different subject to study for each session as not to become overburden . The recommended range of study time is 50 min to 1 hour of study and there should be servers minute of break in each hour  
you need to consider not only what is optimal but also what is realistic for your hours , like 20 minutes study session  is enough for those with a busy schedule 
There is three thing that can cause focus to break down into chunk of time  : 
Your environment : 
the first source of distraction is your environment do you have your phone turn off . Are you prepared to work but you need to find your pen or note  and so on ?  You need to test for the environment that you work best in  . Better to rig your self of this vice to strengthen bad habits of ineffective learning 
Your task  :  
Sometime you need to modify what you are doing to increase greater focus like for example  reading  , when I read  I am easily distracted by my subconscious  though so I write in order to stay focus on the task 
Your mind 
Negative emotions restlessness , and day dreaming can be some of the biggest obstacle  to focusing with problem in your life you will  have a hard time learning well   , you may want to look at dealing  with those first   .Acknowledge the feeling  , be aware of it  , and gently adjust your focus back  to your task  and allow the feeling to pass 
if you feel like continuing on this work is point less because you are so distracted by negative emotion remember that long term persistent on this task will strengthen your focus  , which mean that your time dedicated is not  wasted 
Failing to create the right kind of focus  
you have mangaed to wrangle the problem  of procrastination and distraction but how can you maintain an optimal amount of focus and arousal ? Here is some research for arousal  . When you sleep you have low  arousal when you exercise you have high arousal this occurs due to   sympathetic nervous system activation . Too much arousal however than focus can be loss like any one who  drunk a lot of coffee know how distracting and overstimulate it get . When doing a particularly creative task , if you get struck you may benefit from no focus at all  taking a break from problem can widen your focus .  
endless hours and large swaths of free time on their schedule  
make such large commitment of time  impossible  . Just because you are disciplined in studying for  one area does not mean you are at another  . The best action is too start small  with focusing for 15 minute  then 30  . Over time the dissatisfaction you feel for one subject become smaller and smaller .  

The 
 
## **Why It’s Important:**
It  is importance because it help you  focus on finishing your task enabling you to be more effective in studying  and archiving your goal  
This help you identify when you are losing your focus and enable  you too focus more clearly in your task . 
help with optimizing your study time allowing you regain focus more quickly  
## **Key Examples:** 
Mary Somerville  a women  in the eighteenth century  who have to  confine to a women duty in that time. She have a passion in acquiring knowledge , which lead her to learned several  language  to fluency , and knew how to paint and  play the piano . She was the first women elected to the Royal  Astronomical Society  

Simon   Laplace's  Traite de mecanique celeste , a massive five volumn work on the theory  of gravitation  and advanced mathematics  Even though it seem like what  Mary archive was consider genius  , it was her own  insecurities  like bad memory  recounted thinking that she was to old to learn new thing as a child . Too old for her to learn a foreign language . Her most determine quality was not that she have an incredible intellect but that she have an ability to focus  
The mathematician Paul Erdos was a heavy usre of  amthetamines to increase his capacity to  focus 
,later however the effect only set him  back  a month . So how can some one like  Mary became able to focus under suck pressure  at the time ?  How did Somerville become so good at focusing ?  

The author of the books felt procrastinated when ever he learn Chinese so he added that he will only quick after learning all the rules correctly , even thought it only took him about 20 s more to do fast card his focus when up  


##  **Best Practices:** 
when beginning your study or session of learning . You much first thing say to your self that you will do 5 minute of this work before switching to something else (if the alternative are more pleasing ) or  take a break (if the thing you are learning is too adversarial)  .  
For when you are studying you much find the right environment to study this environment can strengthen your study capacity  helping reduce your distraction level 
but your tasks should not be a distracting factor as well. If you finding creative task  much more challenging you should take a small break  . this is due to the arousal effect  , making it harder to be focus . For an example think of when you drink coffee your brain become hyper sensitive to the environment keeping you from  focusing on your task 

## **How to Apply This Principle:**
i will apply this principle by : 
1. start the initial focus 
	I Can do this by lying to my self that I can study for 5 minute than have break  ,   which will allow my mind enough time to adjust  
2. maintain the initial focus : 
	I will maintain my focus by disabling any distracting devices like iphone and computer , or application notification that I found unecssary  .  then switch up my environment like using music to focus better or not using music at all to figure out which  environment is best suited for my focus 
3. focus on the right task : 
	if a tasks is taking too much time than expected then I should keep a break time for the task , 



## **Chapter [VI]: Principle [Chapter VI Principle 3 Directness Go Straight Ahead]—[Title]**

- **Definition of the Principle:**
The importance of Being direct :  
building the wrong  portfolio  of skills for the kind of career and personal achievements we want to create  example : 
	- we want to wrok on collaborative , professional program but mostly code scripts in isolation 
	- Directly learning the thing we want is too boring , so we settle for an applicaiton to make us feel good than  archive the real thing  
The opposite  of  directness is  often favor  in more traditional class room setting  
Directness is the hallmark of most ultralearning project  Roger 
- **Why It’s Important:**
- **Key Examples:**
Vatsal Jaiswal enter India with the dream of becoming architect . four year later armed with a newly  minted  degree and entering into the worse job market since the great depression that dream begin to be very far away . Frims were layoff every experience architects Most have given up , taking jobs out side their flied  . Vatsal Jaiswal  feel like he ahd been traned in creative design  project that was isolated from building code  , the firm  thing that hiring him will result in a lengthy  hiring training period , something a few firms could currently afford . He found a jobs at a large firms printing shop to scape by  and the shop provided him with experience on what the blue print film were using 
Assorted project from  university   , he focused on a single building of his own design   : a three-tower residential structure with raised courtyards and a modern aesthetic. the project push his skill with software future forcing him to learn new methods and ideas beyond the basic of his online tutorials this project also give him a jobs at two large firms 
though the swath of recent graduates with unimpressive portfolios  there is a real need to connect with people when it is 
enough architectural skill that firms would hire him he opted to build a portfolio using the software those firms used and design 
his knowledge of design theories  interesting and fun . It was disconnected from the actual skill used in  companies 

Roger Craig did his Jeopardy! testing on the actual questions from past shows. Eric Barone learned video game art by making art for his video game. Benny Lewis learns to speak languages quickly by following a policy of attempting some back-and-forth dialog from the very first day. What these approaches share is that the learning activities are always done with a connection to the context in which the skills learned will eventually be used.
