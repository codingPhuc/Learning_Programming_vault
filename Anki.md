## Method 1: Custom Study (Manual Control)

1. **Create a deck** that contains all your questions.
2. **Use tags** to categorize questions (e.g., `Preliminaries`, `Algebra`, etc.).
3. **Custom Study Session:**
    - Click on the deck → Click **Custom Study** → Select **"Limit to particular tags"**
    - Choose the number of questions from each tag (e.g., 5 from `Preliminaries`, 10 from `Algebra`).
    - This needs to be done manually each day.

## Method 2: Using a Filtered Deck (Automated)

4. Create multiple **filtered decks** with a specific number of questions per tag.
5. Example query for a filtered deck:
    `tag:Preliminaries limit:5`
    This will create a deck with 5 questions from the `Preliminaries` tag.
6. Do the same for each category and merge them into your daily study.

## Method 3: Using Anki Add-ons for More Control

7. **"Filtered Decks with Tag and Limit"** (Custom add-ons allow setting specific numbers per tag).
8. **"Advanced Review Scheduler"** (Some add-ons let you control how many questions appear from each tag).
